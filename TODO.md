## Where the work is — frontend, backend, or both

Every section below carries a tag in its heading. **The tag is the first thing to read**: it says
what kind of session can pick the item up, and roughly half of this file cannot be moved at all
from the side you happen to be sitting on.

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **`[FE]`** | Frontend only — React/Next.js under `frontend_react/`. No API change needed. |
| **`[BE]`** | Backend only — FastAPI under `backend/`. The UI is already built and waiting, or the item is invisible to the UI. |
| **`[FE+BE]`** | Needs both, and usually **backend first**: the frontend half is blocked until the field, endpoint or event exists. |
| **`[OPS]`** | Neither — deployment, verification or a third-party account. |

⚠️ **`[FE+BE]` is not "half done on each side".** In almost every case here the frontend is already
built against a shape the backend does not serve yet (organiser console, tags, tickets), so the
frontend half is a *swap*, not a build. Read the section before assuming there is UI work in it.

## 1. `[FE+BE]` Organiser identity on `/event/[id]` is hardcoded — must fix before launch

**Where:** the green header on **both** right-column cards in `app/event/[id]/page.tsx` — the
participant's `BookingCard` and the organiser's `OrganiserEventCard`, which show the same block
(Gautham, 2026-09-01).

Every part of the organiser block is fake: the name is the literal string `"NewFind Collective"` —
the `ORGANISER_NAME` constant both cards are passed — the avatar is that string's first letter, and
"✓ Verified · 40+ events" is a fixed string. There is no organiser lookup, no verification flag and
no event count behind it. Gautham approved this **for now** so the card could match the reference
design. **"Verified" is a trust claim** — it cannot ship to real users as-is.

**Fix:** look the organiser up by `event.organizer_id` via `organizerApi`, then pass real
`organizer` / `verified` / `eventCount` props into both cards, replacing `ORGANISER_NAME`.
`CommunityJoinCard` already does exactly this lookup — **copy it, don't re-derive it.**

⚠️ **The name is the ORGANISATION's, not the person's** (Gautham, 2026-09-01): `company_name` on
`OrganizerProfile`, falling back to `full_name`. `/organizer/onboarding` already collects it and
`organizerApi.get(userId)` already returns it, so **nothing new is needed on the create-event form.**

`OrganizerProfile` also carries `VerificationStatus` (`"unverified" | "pending" | "verified"`), so
the verified flag is `verification_status === "verified"`. **The event count has no backend field
yet and needs one.** Where an organiser is unverified or the count is unknown, **hide the trust
line — do not fake it.**

---

## 2. `[FE+BE]` `Today` and `Recommended` badges are dead for real data

`BADGE_CONFIG` in `EventBadges.tsx` defines both, but `toCarouselEvent()` in `lib/card-adapters.ts`
only ever emits `sold-out`, `selling-fast`, `this-week` and `free`. Nothing else produces
`badgeTypes`, so a real event **cannot** be tagged Today or Recommended — they appear only on the
hardcoded sample array inside `EventsCarousel.tsx`.

**Consequence:** the home page's **"Recommended" filter tab** filters on
`badgeTypes?.includes('recommended')`, so it can never match a live event. The same is why neither
is offered as an `/explore` filter.

**Two ways out, pick one:** emit the tags from `toCarouselEvent` (needs a "recommended" signal from
the backend, and a `today` date check), or drop the tab and both `BADGE_CONFIG` entries.

**Do not solve this one in isolation — see §2b and §17.** The right home for a `recommended` signal
and a `today` check is a backend-owned tag set, not another branch in `toCarouselEvent`. ⚠️ **And
there is no engine to take the signal FROM yet** — the recommendation service's whole algorithm is a
substring match over a user-interests list nothing ever fills, and no frontend code calls it. §17 is
that work; this tab cannot light up before it.

---

## 2b. `[FE+BE]` Tag derivation belongs in the backend — and two more tags are already dead

§2 covers the two badge types nothing emits. This covers the four that *are* emitted: they are all
derived **client-side, per card**, in `toCarouselEvent()` (`lib/card-adapters.ts`).

| Tag | Predicate |
|---|---|
| `sold-out` | `capacity > 0 && tickets_sold >= capacity` |
| `selling-fast` | `!soldOut && capacity > 0 && tickets_sold / capacity > 0.7` |
| `this-week` | `!soldOut && isThisWeek(start_date)` |
| `free` | `price === 0` |

**⚠️ Two of those four can never fire on a real event either.** `tickets_sold` is
`Column(Integer, default=0)` in `services/event/app/models/event.py` and **nothing in the repo ever
writes to it** — a repo-wide grep returns only the column definition, the Pydantic field, fixture
literals and read sites. Tickets never reach the database at all (§11, "real ticket issuance"), so
`tickets_sold` is permanently `0` on live data and **`sold-out` and `selling-fast` appear only on
the dummy fixtures, which hardcode the numbers.** Only `this-week` and `free` survive against a real
backend.

The same zero shows through on the detail page: `/event/[id]` passes `going={event.tickets_sold}`
and `left={capacity - tickets_sold}` into the booking card, so every real event reads "0 going".

**Second problem — the derivation is duplicated.** `app/explore/page.tsx` re-implements the sold-out,
selling-fast and popularity predicates independently of `card-adapters.ts`. Two copies of the 0.7
threshold, free to drift.

**Third — a client-side tag cannot be filtered server-side.** `/event/search` accepts no
`selling_fast` or `this_week` parameter, so the home filter tabs and Explore's "Selling fast" toggle
narrow only the rows already fetched, not the catalogue (`DESIGN_NOTES.md` §10 records this for the
Explore panel). A "Free" tab that silently misses free events further down the result set is worse
than no tab.

**Fix, in order:**
1. **Make `tickets_sold` real** — increment it on issuance. Blocked on §11's real ticket issuance;
   until that lands, anything built on it stays decorative.
2. **Move derivation server-side** — return a computed tag array on the event payload from
   `/event/search` and `/event/{id}`, with the thresholds owned by the event service.
3. **Accept the same tags as filter parameters** on `/event/search`, so the tabs filter the
   catalogue rather than the page.
4. **Reduce `toCarouselEvent` to rendering what it is given**, and delete the duplicate predicates
   in `explore/page.tsx`.

Fold §2 in when this lands — a backend-owned tag set is the natural home for a real `recommended`
signal and a `today` check.

---

## 3. `[BE]` Chat backend — persistence, room list, real unread

The navbar glow and `/chat` inbox are a **frontend-only MVP** (`components/ChatPresence.tsx`). It
opens one WebSocket per room while the app is open and marks a room unread on any inbound message
whose `sender_id` isn't the user's. By design this cannot detect anything received while the app is
closed, and there is no read-receipt state that survives a refresh.

**Needs, in order:**
1. **Message persistence** — `chat_endpoints.py` has its `db.add` / `commit` calls commented out.
2. **A room-list endpoint** — the frontend currently derives rooms from tickets held plus events organised.
3. **A real unread-count / read-receipt mechanism**, then replace `ChatPresence` with it.

Room ids share the WS base (`CHAT_WS_BASE`) with the room page via `lib/chat.ts`. Current unread
state lives in `packages/store/src/chat-unread-store.ts` (persisted map `eventmind-chat-unread`,
plus a non-persisted `activeRoom` so the room you are viewing never glows).

---

## 3b. `[FE+BE]` Join a community — the button exists, nothing behind it

> ⚠️ **Blocked by the Phase 2 park (2026-08-14).** Communities are switched off for the MVP, so
> nothing in this section is reachable by a user. Do not build it before §12 is actioned.

**Where:** `components/CommunityJoinCard.tsx` (the card CTA) and `app/community/[slug]/page.tsx`
(the sticky bar CTA). Both call `handleJoin()`, which is **deliberately empty**. Gautham asked for
the button now and the flow later — do not wire it up halfway.

**Nothing exists on the backend.** `backend/services/community/` has only create / search / get
(`community_endpoints.py`). There is no membership table, no join endpoint, and no notification
hook. `Community.member_count` is a plain `Integer` column with **nothing maintaining it** — it is
whatever the seed script wrote.

**Needs, in order:**

1. **`community_members` table** — `community_id`, `user_id`, `joined_at`; unique on
   `(community_id, user_id)` so a double-click can't join twice. New model beside
   `models/community.py`.
   > ⚠️ Mind the startup-order trap in `CLAUDE.md`: the community service must still create the
   > `communities` table before the user service does. Adding a second table here doesn't change
   > that, but adding a *relationship* to `communities` could.
2. **Endpoints** — `POST /community/{id}/members` (join), `DELETE /community/{id}/members` (leave),
   `GET /community/{id}/members/me` (am I a member?). Join/leave must update `member_count` in the
   same transaction, or drop the column and compute the count — **do not leave two sources of
   truth.**
3. **Notification on new events** — when an event is published with a `community_id`, the
   notification service emails / notifies that community's members. This is the actual feature
   Gautham asked for; the join button is only its entry point. Decide whether it fires from the
   event service on publish or from a Kafka consumer (note Kafka is mocked in dev — `MOCK_KAFKA`).
4. **Frontend join state** — `communityApi.join/leave/membership`, surfaced through React Query.
   Auth-gate the CTA: unauthenticated users go to `/auth` first.

**Then design the joined state** (not yet designed — this is the open question, not a coding task):

- What the CTA becomes — "Joined ✓", a "Leave" affordance, and where leaving lives so it isn't a
  one-click mistake.
- Whether the sticky bar keeps a CTA at all once you're a member, or switches to something else.
- What a member sees that a non-member doesn't — member-only events? a members list? a notification
  preference toggle ("email me about new events")?
- Whether `member_count` visibly increments straight away (optimistic) or after the round-trip.

**Until all of the above lands, the button must keep doing nothing** rather than storing a
device-local "joined" flag — a join that sends no email is not the feature.

---

## 3c. `[FE+BE]` Verify the participant room end to end — and make people in it identifiable

**Why this matters now:** `FeatureBand`'s lead card on the home page says *"Every event has its
own room. Ask the organiser a question, and meet the people going."* That is a claim to every
visitor, so the room needs to be confirmed working, not just confirmed present.

**What has been verified — by reading the code only (2026-08-18):**
- The room id **is the event id** (`app/chat/[roomId]` opens `CHAT_WS_BASE/{roomId}/{userId}`).
- Membership is **tickets held ∪ events organised**, deduped (`app/chat/page.tsx`), so every
  ticket-holder and the organiser resolve to the same room for a given event.
- `ConnectionManager.broadcast_to_room` fans each message out to **every** socket in
  `active_connections[room_id]`, plus a Redis publish for other instances.

So it is a group room by construction, not a 1:1 with the organiser. **Nobody has run two clients
against one event and watched a message land.** Do that first: two browsers, two accounts, both
ticketed on the same event, and confirm each sees the other's message.

**Gaps found while reading — fix before leaning on the card any harder:**
1. **Nobody is identifiable.** Every sender that is not you renders as
   `Attendee <first 4 chars of their UUID, uppercased>`. There is **no organiser branch at all**, so
   the one thing the card tells people to do — ask the organiser — cannot actually be acted on,
   because you cannot tell which message is theirs. The page already knows `roomId === event.id`,
   so look the event up and compare `msg.sender_id` against `organizer_id` to badge them. Real
   display names need a user lookup (`GET /user/{id}`) or a name on the broadcast payload.
2. **Nothing persists** — see §3. Two people in the room at different times see an empty room, so
   "meet the people going" only works if they happen to be online together.
3. **Post-booking only** — a prospective attendee cannot reach the room at all, which is the same
   shape of problem as §7b. The card's copy deliberately does not say *when* you can chat, so it
   stays accurate either way; do not "clarify" it.

---

## 4. `[BE]` Ticketmaster geocoding

Ingestion runs, but many Ticketmaster events carry no venue coordinates and are currently saved with
`lat: 0, lng: 0`. That is a real point in the Atlantic, so those events fall out of every radius
search. Needs a geocoding API (Google Maps or Nominatim) in
`backend/services/recommendation/app/services/ticketmaster_ingestion.py`.

Note `eventCoords()` in `SimilarEvents.tsx` already treats `0,0` as "no coordinates" — keep that
guard until this is fixed.

Once geocoding works end to end, `seed_events.py` is no longer needed for populating **events**
(still useful for communities).

---

## 5. `[FE]` Auth guards race zustand hydration — NEEDS A DECISION (behaviour change)

Every guard is `useEffect(() => { if (!isAuthenticated) router.replace("/auth") })`, which fires on
the first client render — **before** zustand's `persist` has rehydrated `eventmind-auth` from
localStorage. So `isAuthenticated` is still `false`, the guard redirects, and `/auth` (seeing the
now-hydrated session) sends the user on to `/`.

Reproduced repeatedly on `/dashboard`, `/organizer`, `/organizer/my-events`: a hard load lands on
`/`, a soft client-side navigation usually survives — the signature of a hydration race, and why it
looks intermittent in normal use.

**The fix already exists in the codebase and is simply not used here.** The store exposes
`_hasHydrated`, and `app/page.tsx` already gates on it
(`hasHydrated ? _selectedCity : DEFAULT_CITY`); `/chat` does too. The guards should do the same —
wait for `_hasHydrated` before deciding, and render the loader until then.

**Do not "fix" it by removing the guard.** Flagged as needing a decision only because it is an
auth-behaviour change rather than a layout one.

---

## 6. `[FE]` Event card meta row is over-stuffed at `xl:grid-cols-4` — NEEDS A DECISION

Measured at 1440px: the row is 285px and the fixed content (calendar + date + clock + time + pin,
all `shrink-0` at 18px) eats 241px, leaving the venue **44px** — so even "The Blue Room" truncates
to "The…". It looks fine at `sm:grid-cols-2`, where cards are wider.

**Pre-existing, not caused by the clock icon** — the old `date · time · pin venue` layout left the
venue 47px, a 3px difference.

**Options, all of which change the card:** drop the venue from the row, wrap to a second line, or
shrink the row's 18px type (limited by the 15px font floor).

---

## 7. `[FE]` Chat launcher overlaps the last Similar-events card — NEEDS A DECISION

`EventChatWidget`'s terracotta button is `position: fixed` bottom-right and the Similar events rail
is full-bleed, so the button sits over the **fourth card's lower-right corner** — measured at 1440px
(card ends x=1392, button spans 1360–1416) and 1920px (card ends 1872, button 1840–1896). It covers
part of that card's "View details" CTA; the rest of the card still works, since the whole card is a
link.

Partly pre-existing — the two already collided at 1440px when the rail sat inside the capped
column — but full-bleed made it happen at **every** width.

**Every obvious remedy has a cost:** right-padding the rail breaks the four-across maths and home
parity, and moving or hiding the launcher changes a shared component used across the page.

---

## 7b. `[FE+BE]` Should the event assistant be open to users not registered for the event? — NEEDS A DECISION

The AI assistant in `EventChatWidget` is gated to the organiser or a ticket-holder, on both sides:
the backend 403s any other caller (`chat_endpoint.py`, the `_user_has_ticket` check), and the widget
mirrors that client-side with an `access` state, so a browsing visitor never sees an error — they
get a designed locked panel reading **"Attendees only / Register for this event to unlock the AI
event assistant"** (signed-out users get **"Sign in to chat"** instead).

**The question:** the launcher is visible to everyone on `/event/[id]`, but only works after you
book. That is backwards from the moment the assistant is most useful — a prospective attendee
deciding *whether* to go is exactly who has questions about what to bring, where it is, and what to
expect. Today they can open the panel and be turned away.

**Three ways to go, all with a real cost:**

1. **Open it to everyone.** Drop the ticket check for non-organiser callers. Best for conversion,
   and it makes the feature advertisable on the home page. Costs: every anonymous visitor becomes a
   billable OpenAI call with no rate limit in front of it, and the widget currently sends `user_id`
   with no signed-out path — an unauthenticated caller has no id to send.
2. **Open it to signed-in users only.** Keeps a real identity on every call and gives a natural
   throttle key; still turns away the anonymous browser. `no_auth` keeps its current panel,
   `no_access` goes away.
3. **Leave it gated and hide the launcher** when `access` is `no_auth` / `no_access`, so nobody is
   offered a control they can't use. Cheapest, but gives up the pre-booking use case entirely.

**Blocks the home-page features section** — whether we can advertise the assistant, and how the
copy has to be worded, depends on this answer.

If 1 or 2 is chosen, also decide: rate limiting (the gateway's 60/min is per-IP and global, not
per-user), whether the system prompt's role note needs a third "prospective attendee" variant
alongside the organiser/attendee ones, and whether an un-booked visitor should see a nudge to
register in the assistant's answers.

---

## 8. `[FE]` Home-page filter tabs — DECIDED for events, still open for communities

**`EventsCarousel.tsx` is done (Gautham, 2026-08-21).** Both its rows — offline and online — are
now `rounded-xl`, deliberately taking the event card's **"View details" CTA silhouette** rather than
the `rounded-lg` the shape rule prescribes for small controls. Gautham compared the two live and
picked this one. It is an approved departure, **not a stray to sweep to `rounded-lg`** — and the
tabs and that CTA now move together (they already share `px-4 py-1.5` and 20px type).

**`CommunityCarousel.tsx` still carries `rounded-full` on both its rows** (lines ~641 and ~818).
Left alone on purpose: communities are parked for Phase 2 (§12), so the file is unreachable and
restyling it would be an unrequested change to parked code. **Match it to `rounded-xl` as part of
the §12 restore**, or the two carousels ship visibly different filter chips.

---

## 9. `[FE]` Remaining icon-set stragglers

`EventIcons.tsx` unified date/time/location/verification, but these are still outline heroicons and
were deliberately left out of scope:

- Decorative **empty-state** calendars in `EventsCarousel` and `community/[slug]`
- The `/checkout` event thumbnail
- The organiser console's `EventIcon` stat glyph

`/checkout`'s "Expiry Date" field keeps its outline calendar **on purpose** — it belongs to the
payment form's own icon family (`CardIcon`, `LockIcon`, `PersonIcon`), and it is a card expiry, not
an event date. Leave it alone.

---

## 10. `[FE]` Dead code awaiting sign-off

> ⚠️ **Nothing community-related belongs in this section.** The whole feature was parked for Phase 2
> on 2026-08-14 (§12) and reads as unused on purpose — `CommunityCarousel.tsx` in particular has no
> live importer for its components. **Parked ≠ dead. Do not add it here and do not delete it.**

- `components/EventCard.tsx` — nothing imports it. Confusingly named: the card actually rendered is
  `EventCardItem` from `EventsCarousel.tsx`. Uses `@eventmind/types Event`, a different shape to
  `CarouselEvent`. Carries `data-keep-type` for its intentional 11/12/14px type.
- `components/ShareButton.tsx` — only importer is `EventCard.tsx`, so effectively dead.
- `PendingIcon` in `components/organizer/ConsoleIcons.tsx` — lost its only caller when the console
  header's "N need you" pill was removed on 2026-09-02 (§24). ⚠️ **Keep it.** It is part of the
  console's chrome glyph set, and the notification bell §24 specifies is the obvious next user —
  a waiting-clock face is exactly what a "refund requested" row wants.
- `eventmind/frontend/` — one stray `.iml` file left from the deleted Flutter app.

Both components were kept only to avoid an unrequested deletion. **Confirm with Gautham before
removing.**

---

## 11. `[mixed]` Smaller gaps

⚠️ **This is the one section with no single tag** — each bullet carries its own, because they have
nothing in common but their size.

- `[FE]` **SEO metadata** on dynamic routes other than `/event/[id]` and `/community/[slug]`.
- `[FE+BE]` **Notification bell** — icon present, no panel, no backend.
- `[FE]` **Help page** — link present, no page.
- `[BE]` **Real ticket issuance** — tickets are Zustand/localStorage only, never written to the database.
- `[FE+BE]` **Social login** — buttons present, disabled.
- `[FE+BE]` **Event image upload** — `image_url` exists and is populated for synced events; no organiser upload path, no field on the create form.
- `[FE+BE]` **Ticket tiers** — backend supports one price per event; Free/Standard/VIP needs schema changes.
- `[FE+BE]` **Networking Profile** — `/dashboard` interests are hardcoded (Technology, AI, Venture Capital); needs real profile storage.
- `[FE]` **One dialog chassis, two definitions.** `components/ModalShell.tsx` is the shared one
  (overlay, panel, title row, Escape, click-outside, portal) and the organiser's edit and cancel
  dialogs use it. **`components/ShareModal.tsx` predates it and still hand-rolls the same chassis** —
  the values were copied across so the three look identical today, which is exactly the drift that
  will not survive the next change to either. Move `ShareModal` onto `ModalShell` (its body becomes
  the story preview + the two action buttons). ⚠️ Note `ShareModal`'s `mounted`-state portal guard is
  a lint error in this repo (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`); `ModalShell` uses a
  `typeof document` check instead and has none — **take the shell's version, not the modal's.**
- `[FE+BE]` **Community reviews are borrowed from the community's events.** There is no community-scoped
  review endpoint — the review service only serves `/review/event/{id}` — so
  `components/CommunityReviews.tsx` fans `useQueries` over the community's most recent past events
  (capped at 6) and averages what comes back. The subtitle says so out loud. If a real
  `/review/community/{id}` ever lands, swap the component's data source and drop the cap; **do not
  relabel the current aggregate as a community rating.**
- `[FE]` **`community_id` is ignored in dummy data mode.** `dummyEventSearch()` in `lib/data-source.ts`
  honours only `event_type`, `category`, `q`, `organizer_id` and `limit`, so in dummy mode every
  community's events rail shows the whole fixture catalogue. That is consistent with dummy mode's
  stated purpose (keep the UI populated for beautifying) — but **don't read the rail's contents as
  proof the filter works.** Verify that against `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_MODE=real`.
- `[FE]` **Community share links use `id` where the route resolves by `slug`.** Cards link to `/community/${CommunityItem.id}` and `shareUrl()` deliberately matches, so both are always the same string. In dummy fixtures `slug === id`, so it works today — **if the API ever returns a slug that differs from the id, both break together.** Fix by threading the real `slug` through `toCommunityItem()`.

---

## 12. `[FE]` Phase 2 — un-park the community feature

Communities were cut from the MVP on **2026-08-14** at Gautham's request: users must not encounter
the word "community" anywhere. Nothing was deleted. Current state and the full surface list are in
`STATUS.md`; the *why* is in `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Restore, in order:**

1. **Delete `apps/web/src/app/community/layout.tsx`.** That whole file is the park — a server
   component that redirects the entire `/community/*` segment to `/`. The pages under it were never
   edited and come back untouched.
2. **`grep -rn "PARKED 2026-08-14" apps/web/src apps/web/public`** and uncomment each block. Every
   one carries its own restore note; a handful need more than an uncomment:
   - `app/community/[slug]/layout.tsx` — delete the static `metadata`, uncomment `generateMetadata`, restore its three imports.
   - `app/community/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` and `story/route.tsx` — set `PARKED` to `false` (or delete the const and its `if`), and put `alt` back to `"Community on NewFind"`.
   - `app/explore/page.tsx` — `parseView()` is the choke point; restoring it re-enables `showEvents`/`showCommunities`/`noun`/the `items` memo automatically. Also restore `setView`, `VIEW_SEGMENTS`, `selectView`, the `justify-between` on the switch row, and the `view === "events"` guard on Create Event.
   - `app/page.tsx` — widen `exploreHref`'s `view` param back to `"events" | "communities"`.
   - `components/HeroCarousel.tsx` — `subcopy` goes back to the `[SubLine, SubLine]` tuple once the events line 2 returns. ⚠️ Restoring the hero's Events/Communities toggle (parked separately, 2026-08-11) means restoring **all** of this first — see the note in that file.
   - `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — drop the wishlist `.filter()` and rename the prop back to `items`.
3. **Nothing to do on the backend.** The community service, gateway route, models and seed data were
   never touched and have been running throughout.
4. **Re-run the checks:** `pnpm --filter @eventmind/web type-check`, then the responsiveness sweep at
   1024px — restoring the Communities dropdown puts a **third** nav item into the desktop row beside
   Participants and Organisers, and that row is the width that breaks first. The navbar search box is
   `w-[170px] xl:w-[410px]`, both below the values that were measured to fit *with* that dropdown
   present, so this should pass; verify rather than assume.

## 13. `[FE+BE]` Pricing — free to list, 2% on paid events

**Decided by Gautham (2026-08-17), amended 2026-08-19:** listing an event is free, free events cost
**both sides** nothing ever, and paid events carry a flat **2% convenience fee — paid by the
PARTICIPANT, not the organiser.** ⚠️ **That amendment changes the build, not just the wording.** The
fee is added on top of the ticket price at checkout, not deducted from the organiser's payout, so
the buyer's total is `price + 2%` and the organiser is made whole. The `FeatureBand` pricing card
("Free to list. Small fee for paid events.") states it in exactly those terms and is **live on the
home page ahead of any implementation** — so this is a promise already on the page, not a
nice-to-have. Do not build the organiser-pays version the earlier wording implied.

**Nothing exists.** There is no fee, commission, payout or invoicing code anywhere in the backend.

**Needs:**
1. The fee applied at checkout and **itemised as the participant's line** — `/checkout/[id]`
   currently adds a flat `2.5` service fee that is unrelated to this and needs reconciling against
   it. The home page calls it a *convenience fee*; the checkout label should not invent a third name.
2. The fee shown on the **event/checkout side before the participant commits**, so the total isn't a
   surprise — and stated on `/organizer/create` too, since an organiser setting a price needs to
   know what their attendee will actually be charged.
3. Reconciliation against the Stripe intent, and a payout path to the organiser **for the full ticket
   price** (the platform keeps the separately-collected 2%).

⚠️ **Sits behind real payment confirmation.** `/checkout/[id]` creates a genuine PaymentIntent but
never confirms it — success is a hardcoded 2 s `setTimeout` — and tickets never reach the ticketing
DB (§11). A percentage of a payment that never completes is meaningless, so do §11's real ticket
issuance and real payment capture first.

---

## 14. `[BE]` Organiser stats dashboard

**Promised on the home-page `FeatureBand`** ("Everything an organiser wants, in one place — see all
your event info and stats in the organiser dashboard, one at a time, or all together"), and intended
for the MVP.

⚠️ **That copy was softened on 2026-08-19 and no longer names a figure.** It used to promise
"tickets sold, revenue, and how each event is tracking", which set a bar nothing could clear:
"tickets sold" needs real ticket issuance (§11) and a real `tickets_sold` (§2b — nothing writes to
that column today), and "revenue" needs payments that actually complete (§13). The card now says
"info and stats", so **event counts and statuses honestly satisfy it** and the two harder figures
can follow their dependencies. **Do not put revenue or tickets-sold back into the card before the
numbers behind them are real, and do not wire the page to the existing hardcoded constants and call
it done.**

**Wanted:** per-event stats, all-events aggregate, and any organiser-selected subset.

**✅ BUILT 2026-08-20 — the front end of this is done.** `app/organizer/page.tsx` was replaced by the
multi-section console at `app/organizer/(console)/*` (dashboard v2, imported from Claude Design). What
that closed:
- The three hardcoded constants (**Total Revenue `12450`**, **Total Attendees `1,240`**, per-row
  `price * 120`) are **gone**. Revenue is now `tickets_sold × price` in the event's own currency, and
  every figure without a real source prints an em dash instead of a number.
- ⚠️ **The live bug is FIXED.** The old page called `eventsApi.search()` with **no `organizer_id`**,
  so "Your Managed Events" listed every published event on the platform rather than the signed-in
  organiser's. The console fetches through `organizerSource.events(organiserId)`, which passes it.

**Still blocked on the same data as §13 and §11:** attendee counts need `tickets_sold` to be real
(§2b), and revenue needs payments to actually complete. The console reports event counts, statuses
and sold/capacity honestly and says plainly where a figure has no source — **the remaining backend
work is itemised in §19.**

---

## 15. `[FE]` `FeatureBand` — a "plenty to choose from" card for participants — LATER, NOT NOW

**Wanted by Gautham (2026-08-19), deliberately deferred.** A participant tile on the home-page
`FeatureBand` whose message is *"choose from the plethora of options we have on this website"* —
breadth of catalogue as a reason to use NewFind.

⚠️ **The trigger is the only thing holding it back, and it is a number, not a date.** The claim is
only true once there are enough events live to boast about, so **do not add this card until the real
catalogue backs it.** A breadth claim on a thin catalogue is the same failure mode as the dead
`Recommended` badge (§2): it breaks on the first click, on the page that is supposed to earn trust.
There is no agreed threshold yet — **ask Gautham for the number before building it**, and check it
against `/event/search`, not against a seeded or dummy-mode database.

**Where it goes:** the participants half of `components/FeatureBand.tsx`. That half currently runs
two cards plus its CTA tile because **"Everything in one feed" is commented out there** — it made a
neighbouring breadth claim ("big-name listings and independent organisers … one place, not five
tabs"), so **decide between the two rather than shipping both**; two adjacent tiles both saying
"lots of events" reads as padding. ⚠️ **Adding a tile is a layout change**: the band is one flat grid
whose top step is `band:grid-cols-7`, matching today's seven tiles exactly, so an eighth needs that
count and probably its 1400px breakpoint re-picked — see the notes in the component.

**Reuse the live count — do not hardcode a figure.** `HeroCarousel`'s "About N options" is already
this exact pattern: `GET /event/count` → `eventsSource.count()` → React Query, rounded to the
nearest 10, and it renders **no number at all** below 10 rather than "0 options". A card that names
a figure must take it from there and must degrade the same way, so the copy has to hold together
with the number absent (loading, failure, or a thin catalogue). If the copy can only work with a
number in it, it is not ready to ship.

⚠️ **Not a recommendations claim.** "Lots to choose from" is about the catalogue; it must not drift
into "we'll pick the right ones for you", which is §2 and is not built.

---

## 16. `[FE]` Event rooms are being parked for Phase 2 — the `FeatureBand` chat card goes with them

**Gautham's plan (2026-08-20), mostly not yet actioned.** The per-event chat room every event
carries is to be **commented out and pushed to the next phase**, the same way communities were
parked on 2026-08-14 — parked, not deleted.

> ⚠️ **One piece of this IS done, and it was a deletion, not a parking.** The organiser console's
> **Event rooms section** was removed outright on 2026-09-01 (Gautham) — see §19's header. That was
> the organiser's private mirror of the room, and it is gone for good, not commented out. **The
> participant-facing room is a separate question and is still fully live** — `/chat`,
> `/chat/[roomId]`, `EventChatWidget`, `ChatPresence` and the `FeatureBand` tile below are all
> untouched, and everything in this section still applies to them.

⚠️ **The home page advertises it, so the copy has to move in the SAME change.** `FeatureBand`'s
lead participant tile is *"Talk to the organiser before you go — Every event has its own room. Ask
the organiser, meet the people going, even before it starts. Say goodbye to endless emails."* The
moment rooms are unreachable that tile is **a promise the product cannot keep**, on the page whose
whole job is to earn trust. It is the first card a participant reads.

**Adjust the card — do not just delete it and leave a hole.** In order of preference:
1. **Comment it out** alongside the room code, exactly like the parked "Everything in one feed"
   card two lines below it in `FEATURES.participants`. That leaves the participants half with one
   feature tile plus its CTA.
2. **Or replace it** with §15's "plenty to choose from" tile if the catalogue is big enough by then —
   that would keep the half at two feature tiles and needs no grid change.

⚠️ **Removing a tile IS a layout change.** The band is one flat grid whose top step is
`band:grid-cols-7`, sized to exactly today's seven tiles. Dropping the chat card makes it six, so
`grid-cols-7` must become `grid-cols-6` **and** its 1400px breakpoint should be re-picked — six wider
tiles need less room, so the row can start earlier. The narrower steps are bound with `max-band:`
for a reason; read the notes in the component and beside `--breakpoint-band` in `globals.css`
before touching them.

**What else names the room, and must be swept in the same pass:**
- `components/ChatPresence.tsx` — the app-wide listener mounted in `layout.tsx` that lights the
  navbar's chat glow. Its whole purpose is per-event rooms.
- The chat button in `components/navbar/Navbar.tsx` and its unread dot (`eventmind-chat-unread`).
- `/chat`, and the room entry point on `/event/[id]`.
- ⚠️ **`EventChatWidget.tsx` is NOT this.** That is the AI event assistant, a different feature that
  stays — and `FeatureBand`'s second participant tile ("An AI assistant that knows the event inside
  out") is about the assistant, not the room. **Do not park that card by mistake.**

**Related, and partly superseded by this:** §3 (chat persistence, room list, real unread) and §7b
(should the assistant open to unregistered users) — §3's work is exactly what parking defers.

---

## 17. `[BE]` The "Recommended" tab has no recommendation engine behind it — build one

**Gautham (2026-08-20): there is no working recommendation system, and the home page's "Recommended"
tab needs one.** §2 records the symptom on the frontend (nothing ever emits a `recommended` badge, so
the tab matches zero events); this is the backend half, and it is the bigger one. **Do §2 and this
together — neither is worth doing alone.**

**What actually exists today** (`backend/services/recommendation/`):
- `app/services/recommendation_logic.py` — `generate_recommendations(user_id)`: fetches the user
  profile, fetches `/events/search?status=published`, and keeps an event if its `category` is in
  `user.interests` **or** if any interest string appears in the event description. That is the whole
  algorithm: a substring match. No scoring, no ranking, no ordering, and **no limit** — it returns
  every match in whatever order the event service listed them.
- `app/api/reco_endpoints.py` — `GET /recommendations/for-you?user_id=…` wraps it. Also
  `GET /recommendations/trending`, which **returns a hardcoded `[]`**, and
  `POST /recommendations/refresh/{user_id}`, which returns a "task started" message and starts
  nothing.
- ⚠️ **Nothing on the frontend calls any of them.** `packages/api` only reaches this service for
  `ingestCity()` (the Ticketmaster pipeline, which lives in the same service but is unrelated work).

**⚠️ It cannot work as written, for three reasons — fix these before tuning any algorithm:**
1. **`user.interests` is effectively always empty.** The column exists
   (`user_profile.py`, `Column(JSON, default=[])`) but nothing in the product ever fills it: the
   interests block on `/dashboard` is **hardcoded display values** (see `STATUS.md`), and there is no
   UI to set them. An interest-matching engine over an empty interest list returns `[]` for every
   user. **Either collect interests (onboarding, or infer from bookings) or pick a signal that
   exists.**
2. **The behavioural signals it would otherwise use are also empty** — `tickets_sold` is never
   written (§2b) and tickets never reach the DB (§11), so "people who booked X also booked Y" and
   any popularity ranking have no data yet. `/recommendations/trending` returning `[]` is honest
   about that.
3. **It needs Redis.** `RecommendationService.__init__` constructs a `redis.Redis` client at import
   and caches results for an hour. The dev launchers run with `REDIS_HOST=MOCK`, so **verify the
   cache path works (or is bypassed) under the mock before trusting a local test.**

**A defensible first version, in order:**
1. **Decide what "recommended" means and write it down** — it is a promise on the home page. With no
   interests and no booking history, the honest MVP is *proximity + upcoming + category affinity from
   what the user has actually viewed or wishlisted* (`eventmind-wishlist` is real and local; a
   server-side view/wishlist signal would need adding).
2. **Return a RANKED, LIMITED list**, not every match — with a score, so the frontend can take a top N.
3. **Expose it through the gateway** (`/recommendation/*` → the service) and add a `packages/api`
   client beside `ingestCity()`; today there is no frontend path to it at all.
4. **Feed the badge from the backend**, per §2b — the `recommended` flag belongs in a backend-owned
   tag set, not another branch in `toCarouselEvent()`. That is what finally makes the tab match
   something.
5. **Handle the cold-start case explicitly.** A new, signed-out, or interest-less user must get
   *something* sensible (nearest upcoming events) or the tab shows an empty state on a fresh account
   — which is exactly today's bug wearing a new coat.

⚠️ **Until this ships, do not advertise recommendations anywhere in the UI** — `FeatureBand` has a
standing rule against it (see the component header), and `STATUS.md` lists the dead badge under
known-wrong. **A "Recommended" tab that matches nothing is worse than no tab**, so if this work is
not being picked up, take §2's second option and drop the tab instead.

## 18. `[OPS]` Verify event/community share on a public deploy — the link unfurl (1b) cannot be tested on localhost

The share feature is built and works: the Share button (on event/community cards + the event hero)
hands the generated **story image** (1c, `/{event,community}/[id]/story` → PNG) to the native share
sheet on mobile, and the **link-unfurl** metadata (1b) is emitted by `generateMetadata()` +
`opengraph-image.tsx`. Both images render correctly (verified locally).

**What can't be tested locally — and why:** the 1b card is drawn by whatever app the link is *pasted
into* (WhatsApp, iMessage, Slack, X), which fetches the page's Open Graph tags from a **public URL**.
On dev the links are `http://localhost:3000/...`, which only resolve on the dev machine, so no
external app can reach them — pasting a link shows a bare URL with no card. This is expected, not a
bug. (Gautham hit this on 2026-08-20: clicking Share opened the Windows OS share sheet, and Copy link
pasted a non-previewing localhost URL.)

**To verify after deploying to a public domain:**
1. Set **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`** (e.g. `https://newfind.co`) in the deploy env so `og:url`,
   `og:image` and the copied link are absolute + reachable. Without it they default to
   `http://localhost:3000` and the unfurl stays broken in prod.
2. Paste a real event link into WhatsApp / iMessage / Slack and confirm the **1b** card renders
   (image left, mark → title → place · date · price). Debug with the metadata validators
   (opengraph.xyz, Slack's link unfurl, X card validator) — they fetch the URL live.
3. On a phone, tap Share and confirm the **1c** story PNG reaches the native sheet (post to a story).

**Optional desktop polish (deferred, Gautham to decide):** on desktop the browser's Web Share API
opens the clumsy OS share sheet. We could instead show our own popup there (preview of the 1c card +
Download image + Copy link — the `ShareModal` fallback already exists; just gate native share to
mobile). Left as-is for now.

---

## 19. `[BE]` Organiser console — the backend behind the dashboard v2

**The UI is built and live** (`app/organizer/(console)/*`, imported from the Claude Design file
"Organiser Dashboard v2", 2026-08-20). Four sections: Dashboard, Events, Attendees, Earnings.
**One of them is real; three are waiting on endpoints that do not exist.**

> ⚠️ **TWO SECTIONS WERE DELETED ON 2026-09-01 (Gautham), and neither is rebuilt without asking.**
>
> - **Settings** — route, rail item and gear glyph gone, with the organiser-profile /
>   event-defaults / team-&-notifications groups. Only its four **payment terms** survive, as a
>   read-only card at the foot of Earnings (`dummyPaymentTerms` → `organizerSource.paymentTerms()`).
>   **When §19.5 below is built, it lands in that card — do not rebuild the section to hold it.**
> - **Event rooms** — route, `RoomsIcon`, `dummyRooms`, `dummyThreads`, `organizerSource.rooms()` /
>   `.thread()` and the whole `unread` question count, gone. Attendee conversation happens in the
>   **chat** surfaces for organisers and participants alike; making that work for an organiser is a
>   backend job, restated in §19.1 below. **Nothing counts unanswered questions any more**, which is
>   why the header's "N need you" pill is attendees-only and the dashboard hero lost its "Questions"
>   tile and both room CTAs. Do not reintroduce a count that can only print zero.

**Real today:** Dashboard + Events, from `eventsSource.search({ organizer_id })` via
`organizerSource.events()`. Event, when, where, sold (`tickets_sold`/`capacity`), gross revenue
(`tickets_sold × price`, in the event's own currency) and the live/upcoming/past/draft buckets are
all derived from data the events service actually returns.

**Not real — and deliberately NOT faked.** In `dummy` data mode these render the fixtures in
`lib/fixtures/organizer.ts` so the whole design is visible with no backend; in `real` mode
`organizerSource` returns empty and each section renders `NotBuiltYet`, which says the endpoint does
not exist rather than showing a zero. ⚠️ **Do not "fix" that by serving the fixtures in real mode** —
an organiser reading invented revenue or invented attendees for their own event is the one failure
this design must not have.

> ⚠️ **EVERY NUMBER ON THIS CONSOLE IS THE BACKEND'S JOB FOR A REAL EVENT** (Gautham,
> 2026-08-21). The revenue figures, the earnings table and its totals, the portfolio roll-ups,
> the check-in rate, the refund amounts, the unread counts — all of it. What the fixtures do is
> **derive** those figures from the organiser's own events (`dummyMyEvents` in
> `lib/fixtures/events.ts`), so the shape of the answer is already settled and the front end has
> nowhere left to invent one. **That derivation is a specification, not an implementation** — it
> runs on eight fixture events in one currency with no concurrency and no money movement, and
> every item below is what it takes to compute the same thing honestly. The rule that survives
> into production: a figure with no source prints an em dash, never a `0`.

**Endpoints needed, roughly in the order they unblock the most screen:**
1. **The organiser's side of the event chat** — ⚠️ **restated 2026-09-01 (Gautham). This is no
   longer a console section; it is a chat feature.** The console's Event rooms page is deleted, and
   the requirement in its place is that an organiser and their attendees talk in the **same chat
   surfaces everyone else uses** (`/chat`, `/chat/[roomId]` — *not* `EventChatWidget`, which is the
   AI assistant; see §16) rather than in a private organiser mirror of them. What is missing is entirely backend: the chat service has no
   organiser-room concept, does not persist messages (§3), and cannot tell an organiser's message
   from an attendee's — so there is no unread count, no question/answered state and no way to post
   an update to a room. **Build it in the chat service under §3 / §3c, not as a new console page.**
2. **Attendees** — organiser-scoped ticket holders per event: name, contact, ticket type, amount
   paid, booked-at, status. Blocked on real ticket issuance (§11) — nothing writes tickets to the
   ticketing DB today.
3. **Check-ins** — a check-in record per ticket, and the door flow behind "Start check-in mode".
   Everywhere a check-in figure would go currently prints an em dash, never a `0`: "nobody has
   arrived" and "we do not record arrivals" are different statements and must not be conflated.
4. **Earnings** — per-event settlement. ⚠️ **The organiser keeps the full ticket price.** The 2% is
   the participant's convenience fee, added on top at checkout (§13, amended 2026-08-19), so
   `net = gross − refunds` and the fee column is informational. The imported design deducted it from
   the organiser and that framing was **removed on import** — do not reintroduce it. Blocked on
   payments actually completing (§13) and on refunds existing at all (**§21** — which is also where
   "does the buyer's 2% come back on a refund?" gets answered; this column's arithmetic assumes not).
5. **Payment terms** — a preferences record behind the four rows the Earnings page prints:
   receiving account, convenience fee, refund window, who approves refunds. Read-only today, and
   the account is a fixture string; company details remain editable on `/organizer/onboarding`.
   ⚠️ **Scope shrank on 2026-09-01** — default visibility, waitlist, room-on-publish, notification
   routing and co-organisers were deleted with the Settings section and are **not** waiting on this
   endpoint. Do not build them back in on the strength of this item.
6. **Drafts** — `eventsApi.search` hardcodes `status: "published"`, so an organiser cannot list
   their own drafts. The Drafts tab is therefore always empty against a live backend. Needs either
   an organiser-scoped event endpoint or a `status` passthrough.
7. **Console search + filters** — the header search box is a disabled control with a title
   explaining why. ⚠️ **Events is the reference**: its price filter and date sort run client-side
   over rows `useOrganiserEvents` has already fetched, via `FilterSelect` in `ConsoleUI.tsx` and
   `filterAndSortRows` in `lib/organizer-rows.ts`. **Where the rows are already in memory, do the
   work rather than disabling the control.** Applying that rule (2026-08-24), **Attendees and
   Earnings now each have a working per-event `FilterSelect`** bound to `?event=<id>` — which is
   also how `/event/[id]`'s organiser card deep-links into them (`manageAttendeesHref` /
   `manageRevenueHref`). **Still disabled and still waiting on a backend:** the header search, the
   Attendees ticket-type and status dropdowns, and the Earnings date range — those genuinely need an
   organiser-scoped query endpoint, since the fixtures hold one sample rather than a full list.
   ⚠️ Both pages test `NotBuiltYet` against the **unfiltered** list; a filter matching nothing
   renders an `EmptyState` instead. Do not collapse those two states into one.
8. **Event visibility (public/private)** — there is no visibility column. The console used to stamp
   a hardcoded "Public" pill on every row and describe an invite-only mode in three places; all of
   it was removed on 2026-08-21 (Gautham: there are only public events). **Do not reintroduce a
   badge, a filter or the copy until the column exists** — a badge that can only say one thing
   carries no information, and a wrong privacy claim is worse than no claim. When it lands, add
   `visibility` back to `ConsoleRow` in `lib/organizer-rows.ts` and let the pill read it.
9. **Portfolio roll-ups** — `GET /organizer/{id}/overview`, serving what `dummyPortfolio` computes:
   events run, tickets sold (plus the last-7-days delta), net revenue, check-in rate, refunds
   issued, average ticket. ⚠️ **These must be computed BY the backend, not by summing whatever the
   events endpoint happened to return** — a paged or filtered event list would silently under-report
   an organiser's revenue, which is the worst kind of wrong number: plausible. Depends on 2, 3, 4.
10. **A currency answer for a multi-currency organiser.** Every total on the Dashboard and the
    Earnings page ADDS ROWS UP, and an organiser with a London event and a Mumbai one has no single
    honest total. The fixtures dodge this by asserting one currency (`assertOneCurrency`) and the
    pages read the currency off the data rather than naming one — so the **front end is ready and
    the product decision is not**. Pick one before this ships: totals split per currency, or
    converted at a stated rate on a stated date. **Do not let it default to "whatever the first row
    said".**
    ⚠️ **One half of this is now settled and it is NOT the totals half.** A single event's currency
    can no longer move: price and currency are chosen once on `/organizer/create` and the edit
    dialog shows both read-only (Gautham, 2026-09-01) — so a row's totals can never be a sum across
    two currencies *within one event*. **The open question is unchanged and is the harder one:** an
    organiser running events in two currencies still has no honest single total on the Dashboard or
    the Earnings page. Do not read the locked field as this item being done.
11. **The `tickets_sold` column has to become real first.** Revenue on this console is
    `tickets_sold × price`, and nothing writes that column today (§2b) — so on a live backend the
    Events table's Revenue column is currently `0 × price` for every row. That is the single
    highest-leverage item in this list: it is upstream of 2, 4, 9 and of §14's promise.

12. **The organiser-authored extras have no columns — agenda, announcements, FAQ, offer name, and
    an editable cover image.** The whole frontend shipped on 2026-08-24 (Gautham asked for it, and
    chose frontend-only over a migration): `/event/[id]` renders all three lists publicly, the
    organiser authors them through `EditListModal`, and the offer name and cover image are fields in
    `EditEventModal`. **On 2026-08-31 the agenda and the FAQ also became sections of
    `/organizer/create`** (same call, same trade — frontend now, columns later), so an organiser can
    seed both while writing the event instead of only after it exists. **Every one of those controls
    is disabled in real mode**, off `EXTRAS_ARE_LOCAL` in `lib/data-source.ts`, because
    `EventCreate` / `EventUpdate` do not accept the keys and Pydantic drops them silently — an
    organiser would type an agenda, press Save, and watch the server's reply wipe it with no error.
    `lib/event-extras.ts` is the whole gate; read its header.

    What it takes to make them real:
    - **`image_url` is one line and no migration** — the column already exists on `events`, it is
      merely absent from `EventUpdate` in `backend/services/event/app/schemas/event_schemas.py`.
      **Do this one first**, then take `image_url` out of `EXTRA_KEYS`. (Still no *upload*: there is
      no file storage, so the field takes a URL and says so.)
    - **`offer_name`** — a `String(60)` column, plus `EventCreate`/`EventUpdate`/`EventOut`.
    - **`agenda`, `announcements`, `faq`** — three JSON columns (the shapes are already typed as
      `AgendaItem`, `Announcement` and `FaqItem` in `packages/types`), or one `organiser_content`
      JSON blob holding all three. ⚠️ **Not `content_generated`** — that is the AI agents' pipeline
      output, and mixing organiser-authored copy into it means neither side can be cleared without
      destroying the other.
    - ⚠️ **`agenda` and `faq` must land on `EventCreate` too, not only `EventUpdate`** — the create
      form sends them today and `eventsSource.create()` strips them on the way out. Adding them to
      `EventUpdate` alone would leave the create form silently lossy while the edit dialog worked,
      which is the confusing half-state this gate exists to avoid. (`announcements` is
      update-only by design — see the note at the bottom of this item.)
    - **All four need a migration script.** There is no Alembic: `create_all` only ever CREATES
      tables, so an added column 500s every query against the existing `platform_dev.db` until an
      idempotent `ALTER` has run. Copy `backend/scripts/migrate_add_currency_column.py` — it has the
      per-dialect `COLUMNS` dict that keeps SQLite and Postgres both working.
    - **Then delete the strip in `eventsSource.create()` AND `eventsSource.update()`, and
      `EXTRA_KEYS` with them** — there are now two, and either one left behind goes on discarding
      exactly the fields this work made real.
    - **Then flip the create form's editors on.** They read `!EXTRAS_ARE_LOCAL` for `disabled`;
      once the columns exist that gate is wrong there and the `disabledNote` copy goes with it.
    - ⚠️ **An announcement is not a notification.** Posting one changes the page and reaches nobody;
      the dialog says so. Wiring it to the notification service is §20's problem, not this one.
    - ⚠️ **Announcements are deliberately NOT on the create form** (Gautham, 2026-08-31). One is an
      update posted to an event people have already booked — dated, and rendered newest-first — so
      there is nothing to update at the moment the event is being written. **Do not "complete the
      set" by adding a third section there.**

**Access control — DONE for the console, still open for the API (2026-08-21).** `/organizer/*` now
requires an organiser PROFILE, not merely a login: `useOrganiser` returns `isOrganiser`, and the
console layout renders an explaining state with a "Become an organiser" link instead of the console.
Dummy mode treats whoever is signed in as the organiser on purpose — that is the development setup.
⚠️ **The remaining half is the backend's.** The console is only as private as the endpoints behind
it: every one of the items above must be scoped to the caller's own `organizer_id` server-side and
must reject a request for someone else's event, because a front-end guard stops a person clicking,
not a person curling. Attendee contact details and revenue are the two that matter most.

**Also worth doing here:** `/organizer/my-events` now overlaps the console's Events section almost
exactly. Both are reachable from the navbar. Decide whether to retire it and point its navbar entry
at `/organizer/events` — Gautham's call, not a silent deletion.

## 20. `[BE]` Postponing and cancelling an event — the frontend is done, nothing is told

**Shipped on the frontend 2026-08-21 (Gautham).** An organiser viewing their own `/event/[id]` can
switch to an organiser view and either **edit the details** (description, start/end date & time,
city, venue or online link) or **cancel the event**. Both write through
`eventsSource.update()` → `PATCH /event/{id}`, which already exists and works.

**What the backend does today:** `update_event` in
`backend/services/event/app/api/event_endpoints.py` copies the submitted fields onto the row,
commits, and returns it. That is all. It does not know a postponement from a typo fix, it publishes
nothing to Kafka, and **it does not check who is asking** (see the authorisation item below).

**Gautham's requirement (2026-08-21): a postponement and a cancellation must each send every
attendee a notification AND an email.** Neither exists.

**What to build, in order:**

1. **Treat a schedule/venue change as a POSTPONEMENT, not an edit.** Either a dedicated
   `PATCH /events/{id}/reschedule`, or a diff inside `update_event` — but the decision must be made
   in the **event service**, not in the browser. The frontend already tells the organiser "this
   counts as postponing the event" (`EditEventModal.tsx`); the backend currently disagrees silently.
   Publish `event.postponed` with the event id, the **old and new** `start_date` / `end_date` /
   `location`, and the organiser id. `create_event` shows the pattern —
   `background_tasks.add_task(kafka_manager.send, …)`.
2. **Publish `event.cancelled`** the same way when `status` moves to `CANCELLED`. It is a distinct
   message, not a postponement with no new date: the recipient's next action differs completely.
3. **Handlers in the notification service.** `services/notification/app/services/event_handlers.py`
   already has the shape (`handle_ticket_issued` is the closest sibling) and
   `notification_service.send_email` already renders templates. Two new templates and two new
   handlers. ⚠️ **Both need the attendee list, which means the ticketing service** — and nothing
   writes tickets to the database yet (§11, "real ticket issuance"). **That is the true blocker: an
   email pipeline over an empty ticket table sends nothing and looks like it worked.**
4. **In-app notification as well as email.** The bell in the navbar is an icon with no panel and no
   backend (§11) — a "notification" today has nowhere to land. Scope that with this, or the
   requirement is only half met.
5. **Authorisation on the write path — do this one FIRST.** `PATCH /events/{id}` takes no identity
   and checks no ownership: **any caller who knows an event id can rewrite or cancel anyone's
   event.** The gateway forwards the `Authorization` header already, so the fix is to decode the
   JWT in the event service and compare `sub` against `event.organizer_id`. The frontend's
   `ownsEvent()` (`lib/data-source.ts`) only decides whether to *draw* the controls — it is a UI
   gate, not a permission, and it is trivially bypassed with curl. ⚠️ **This is a live hole today,
   not a nice-to-have**, and it got worse the moment the UI made the edit path ordinary.
6. **Refunds on cancellation** — **specced in §21**, and still blocked on payments completing (§13)
   and tickets existing (§11). ⚠️ **§21's decision 5 is this one:** whether a cancellation refunds
   automatically or raises a request the organiser approves — an attendee whose event was called off
   did nothing to warrant a request queue. Decide it here, with this section. The cancel dialog says
   plainly that no refunds are issued; when that changes, change the dialog in the same commit.

**Two smaller frontend follow-ups**, deliberately left out and to be picked up with the above rather
than on their own:

- **A `Postponed` badge.** Nothing marks a moved event on a card or a hero. It needs a real signal
  (a flag or a recorded previous date — a client-side guess is not one) and a `BADGE_CONFIG` entry;
  §2b is the rule for where a tag may be derived. Until then a postponed event looks identical to
  one that was always on that date.
- **Un-cancelling.** `EventStatus` allows it and the API would accept it, but there is no control
  and no copy, on purpose: bringing back an event whose attendees were told it was off is a
  different action from cancelling, and needs its own message.

## 21. `[BE]` How to handle a refund — NEEDS A DECISION on the policy, then a build

**This is referenced from three other sections and specified in none of them** (§19.4 earnings,
§19.9 roll-ups, §20.6 cancellation). Each defers it in a sentence; this is the section they defer
*to*. **The policy half is Gautham's and comes first** — the build below is not startable without it.

**What exists today: two enum members and nothing else.**
- `PaymentStatus.REFUNDED` (`services/payment/app/models/payment.py`) and `TicketStatus.REFUNDED`
  (`services/ticketing/app/models/ticket.py`) are both declared, and **nothing in the repo ever
  writes either** — same shape of dead column as `tickets_sold` (§2b).
- `services/payment/app/services/stripe_service.py` has exactly two methods,
  `create_payment_intent` and `construct_webhook_event`. **There is no `stripe.Refund` call
  anywhere.**
- `payment_endpoints.py` is `POST /create-intent` and `POST /webhook`. **No refund endpoint**, and
  the webhook handles only `payment_intent.succeeded` and `payment_intent.payment_failed` — a
  refund raised *inside the Stripe dashboard* (`charge.refunded`) would fall through unrecorded, so
  the two systems would silently disagree about what was paid.
- There is **no refund record at all** — no table, no requested-by, no approved-by, no reason, no
  timestamp. A refund is an audit trail, not a status flip: `status = REFUNDED` on a ticket cannot
  answer who asked, who approved, when, or how much came back.

⚠️ **The frontend already speaks the whole vocabulary, and it is a specification** (the §19 rule).
`lib/fixtures/organizer.ts` carries per-event `refunds` (an amount) and `refundedTickets` (a count),
an attendee status of **`"Refund requested"`** whose row action is **Review**, the Earnings page's
`net = gross − refunds` column, the portfolio's "Refunds issued" roll-up, and two of the payment
terms at the foot of Earnings — **"Refund window: Up to 48h before"** and **"Who approves refunds:
You"**. **None of that is a decision that has been taken.** They are fixture values standing in for
answers, and the console reads them as read-only. (The "Refund request → Push" notification route
that used to say the same thing a third time went with the Settings section on 2026-09-01.) Do not treat the fixture's 48h and
organiser-approval as settled policy because they are typed somewhere.

**Decide these first — they change what gets built, not just the copy:**

1. **Who initiates, and is approval needed?** The fixtures assume attendee-requests-then-organiser-
   approves. The alternative is a self-serve refund inside the window with no approval step. These
   are different products: one needs a request record, a queue and two notifications; the other
   needs a button and a rule.
2. **The refund window**, and whether an organiser may change it per event. The Earnings row is
   read-only today; if it becomes editable it is a **column on the event**, not a global constant.
3. **⚠️ What happens to the 2% convenience fee.** It is the **participant's** money (§13, amended
   2026-08-19), collected on top of the ticket price, so on a refund it is genuinely open whether
   the buyer gets it back or the platform keeps it as the cost of the transaction. **The fixtures
   dodge this entirely** — `net = gross − refunds` never touches the fee. Whichever way it goes,
   the checkout copy has to say so **before** the buyer pays, or the first refund is the first time
   they hear it.
4. **Partial refunds?** `refunds` in the fixtures is an *amount*, not a ticket count times a price,
   so the shape already permits one. If partials are in, `refundedTickets` and `refunds` can
   disagree and the Earnings table needs to survive that.
5. **An organiser-cancelled event (§20) — automatic or requested?** A cancellation is the one case
   where the attendee did nothing wrong, so a refund request flow is arguably the wrong shape.
   Decide this **with** §20, because `CancelEventModal` currently promises the opposite in writing.

**Then build, in order:**

1. **A refund record** in the payment service — payment intent, ticket, amount, currency, reason,
   requested_by, approved_by, status, timestamps. **Not a status flip on the ticket**, though the
   ticket's `REFUNDED` status is set from it.
2. **`stripe_service.refund(intent_id, amount=None)`** wrapping `stripe.Refund.create`, plus a
   **`charge.refunded` / `charge.refund.updated` branch in the webhook** so a dashboard-initiated
   refund reconciles instead of being lost. Refunds must be **idempotent** — a double-click or a
   webhook redelivery must not refund twice.
3. **Endpoints**, scoped server-side to the caller: request (attendee), approve/decline (organiser,
   and **only for their own event** — the same authorisation hole as §20.5), and read. The organiser
   endpoints belong to the console (§19.2 Attendees, §19.4 Earnings).
4. **Void the ticket and correct the counts** in the same transaction — `tickets_sold` decrements
   (once §2b makes it real), or a sold-out event stays sold out after a refund and the seat is never
   resold.
5. **Notifications and email on every state change** — requested, approved, declined, money sent.
   Same handler shape as §20.3, and blocked on the same missing notification backend (§11).
6. **Serve the figures the console already draws** — per-event `refunds` / `refundedTickets`, the
   Earnings rows, and the "Refunds issued" roll-up, computed by the backend (§19.9's rule: never by
   summing whatever the events endpoint happened to return).

⚠️ **Blocked, and honestly so: there is nothing to refund yet.** Tickets never reach the database
(§11) and `/checkout/[id]` never confirms its PaymentIntent — success is a hardcoded 2 s
`setTimeout` (§13). **A refund pipeline over payments that never completed will pass every test and
move no money.** Do §11 and §13's payment capture first; the policy decisions above can be taken in
parallel and should be, since §13's checkout copy depends on answer 3.

**Frontend follow-ups, to move in the same change and not before:**
- `CancelEventModal.tsx` says **"No refunds are issued"** and `/event/[id]`'s cancelled-event strip
  deliberately says nothing about refunds. **Both are true today and must be edited in the commit
  that makes them false** — not earlier, and not left behind.
- The Attendees row action ("Review" on a refund request) and the Earnings filters are disabled
  controls waiting on §19.7's endpoint.
- `/checkout` must state the refund window and the fee answer **before** payment, per decision 3.

## 22. `[FE]` Design a user-friendly way for an organiser to post an announcement — NEEDS A DECISION

**Raised by Gautham, 2026-08-31, alongside the create-form work (§19.12).** Announcements were
deliberately kept off `/organizer/create` — an announcement updates an event that already exists —
which leaves the *existing* path as the only one, and that path is the problem this section is
about. **This is a design task first and a build task second: do not start building a composer
before the questions below are answered.**

**The path today is seven steps for one sentence.** To tell attendees "the room has moved":

1. Sign in → 2. reach the event (console → Events → Manage, or find it on the site) → 3. land on
`/event/[id]` → 4. make sure you are in the **organiser view** → 5. scroll past the hero, the
description and the agenda to the Announcements section → 6. click **Post an announcement**, which
opens `EditListModal` — *the full list editor*, showing every past announcement as an editable row →
7. **Add** a row, type, **Save changes**.

Three things are wrong with it independently of how many clicks it is:

- **The composer is a list editor.** Posting one new update means opening an editor for the whole
  history, adding a row to the bottom, and pressing a button labelled *Save changes* rather than
  *Post*. Adding is the common case; editing an old post is the rare one, and the UI is built the
  other way round.
- **It is only reachable from the event's public page**, in a mode the organiser has to already be
  in. The organiser console — the surface built for exactly this kind of work — has no way to post
  one against an arbitrary event.
- **The Announcements section is invisible to a participant until it has content** (`showsSection`
  in `EventSections.tsx`), which is right for the reader and means an organiser has no ambient
  reminder the feature exists.

⚠️ **There are already TWO organiser-update surfaces, and nothing has decided how they relate.**
This is the first question to settle, because the answer changes what gets built:

| Surface | What it is | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Announcement** | A dated post on the event's **public page**, read by anyone who opens it — including people who never booked | On the event, via `EditListModal` |
| **"Your updates"** | An organiser message **inside the event's chat room**, read by the people in that room | ⚠️ **Nowhere, since 2026-09-01** — the console's rooms page was the only surface for it and is deleted. It comes back only as part of the chat service's organiser support (§19.1, no backend) |

They currently overlap in the organiser's head and nowhere in the code. Are they one thing with two
audiences, two genuinely different acts, or should posting once optionally do both?

**Questions for Gautham — these change the build, not the copy:**

1. **Where does an organiser expect to post from?** Candidates: a composer on the console dashboard
   (with an event picker), a per-event action on the console's Events table, a quick composer inline
   on `/event/[id]` in organiser view, or all three feeding one place.
2. **Is a new post a different control from editing the history?** The likely answer is yes — a
   small "post" box that appends, with the existing list editor kept behind a quieter "Manage
   announcements". Confirm before building.
3. **The two surfaces above** — one act or two?
4. **Does an announcement deserve a template or two?** The recurring cases are narrow: venue
   changed, time changed, what to bring, cancelled-adjacent. A picker that pre-fills a headline may
   be more "easy" than a blank box — or may be clutter. Gautham's call.
5. **What does the organiser see after posting?** There is no delivery to confirm (see the
   constraint below), so the honest confirmation is "it is on your event page", with a link to it.

**Constraints that already hold — a design that breaks one of these is wrong, not bold:**

- ⚠️ **An announcement is NOT a notification.** Nothing is emailed, pushed or told; a post only
  changes the page. `EditListModal` says so in writing today, and any new composer must too
  (§20, §11). **Do not write "notify attendees" on a button that does not.**
- ⚠️ **No backend column** (§19.12). Every authoring control is disabled off `EXTRAS_ARE_LOCAL` and
  works in `dummy` mode only. A composer built now ships disabled in `real` mode like the rest —
  that is acceptable and is how the agenda and FAQ shipped, but **decide it deliberately** rather
  than discovering it at the end.
- ⚠️ **Editing does not re-stamp `posted_at`** — a typo fix is not a repost. Whatever appends must
  keep that rule.
- ⚠️ **Rendered newest-first, sorted on read** (`announcementsOf`). Order is derived, never chosen,
  so no reorder control.
- ⚠️ **One editor, not two.** `ListEditor.tsx` is the shared row editor behind all three lists. A
  new composer may be a genuinely different control (question 2), but it must not become a second
  implementation of the same rows — extend the `SPEC`, do not fork.
- ⚠️ **Announcements stay off `/organizer/create`** (§19.12, last bullet).

**What can move before the decisions:** nothing structural. The one safe, useful preparatory step is
to **write down the real organiser journeys** — "I need to tell everyone the venue moved, two hours
before doors" — and count the clicks each candidate placement costs. That is the evidence the
questions above need, and `DESIGN_NOTES.md` is where it belongs once measured.

---

## 23. `[BE]` `registration_closed` has no backend — the UI ships ahead of it

**Gautham chose frontend-first, 2026-09-01**, when the lifecycle chip on `/event/[id]` became an
editable four-state select (`components/organizer/EventStatus.tsx`). The state is real in the UI and
**not persistable against the live backend**. Three things are missing, and the second is the one
that would ship a bug if the first landed alone.

1. **The enum.** `backend/services/event/app/models/event.py` declares
   `EventStatus = draft | published | cancelled | completed`. A PATCH carrying
   `status: "registration_closed"` **422s** — which is why the option is disabled off dummy mode
   today (`REGISTRATION_CLOSED_IS_LOCAL` in `EventStatus.tsx`).

2. **⚠️ The search default, and it is not optional.** `event_endpoints.py` defaults both list
   endpoints to `status: Optional[EventStatus] = Query(EventStatus.PUBLISHED)`. Add the enum value
   and nothing else, and a registration-closed event **vanishes from discovery** — the exact
   opposite of what the state promises the organiser ("stays visible to participants"). The default
   has to become *published **or** registration_closed*, and the two endpoints have to agree.
   **Do not land 1 without 2.**

3. **The join gate.** Nothing server-side refuses a booking on a closed event — the frontend
   disables the CTA and `handleBookNow`, and that is all. `/checkout` and the ticketing service must
   reject it too, or a stale tab still buys a ticket. Same class of gap as §20's cancelled events.

**What `completed` becomes.** "Finished" was dropped from the UI in the same change, so
`lifecycleOf()` currently folds `completed` onto `registration_closed` — true of a finished event
(visible, not taking joins) and better than the `draft` fallback, which would have told a
participant the page was invisible to them. If the backend ever needs the two distinguished again,
that is a **product** decision about what a past event's page should say, not a mapping to quietly
change here.

**Frontend work when this lands:** delete `REGISTRATION_CLOSED_IS_LOCAL` and
`REGISTRATION_CLOSED_HINT`, and drop the `reasonFor()` branch that reads them. Nothing else changes
— the select, the copy and the booking gate are already built against the real shape.

---

## 24. `[BE]` Notifications move to the navbar bell — the console pill is gone

**Gautham, 2026-09-02**, on reading the console header: *"I think it's best to remove that honestly.
It's a bit confusing. I think all this 'notifications' should be displayed in the bell icon on the
navbar instead."* The shape was then decided in full (below) and the build **deliberately deferred**,
because the bell is only worth building once something can feed it.

**The two parts are separable and must not be bundled.** Part A is frontend-only and unblocked; part
B is a backend feature. Doing A alone is a net improvement — the pill duplicates the dashboard
column that sits directly beneath it, and does it worse.

### Part A `[FE]` — remove the "N need you" pill. ✅ **DONE 2026-09-02.**

Deleted from `app/organizer/(console)/layout.tsx`: the pill JSX, the `needsYou` `useMemo` and its
`⚠️ ATTENDEES ONLY` comment, the whole `organizer-attendees` `useQuery` (the counter was its only
consumer, so the shell no longer fetches attendees on every console page), and four then-unused
imports — `PendingIcon`, `useMemo`, `useQuery`, `organizerSource`. `isDummyMode` stayed: same
module, still feeding the sample-data footer. A comment marks the spot and points here.

Why it went, for anyone tempted to put a counter back:

1. **It was a dead end.** A `<span>`, not a link — it named a number of chores and gave you nowhere
   to go. The dashboard's *"Needs you today"* column is the same information **with working links**,
   one screen below it.
2. **It read as a message notification**, because it sat immediately beside the inert *"Search
   events, attendees…"* box and looked like a property of the search.

⚠️ **`PendingIcon` (`ConsoleIcons.tsx`) now has no caller.** It stays exported so nothing flags it.
**Do not delete it** — it is part of the console's chrome set and the bell's list is the obvious
next user. Logged in §10.

### ⚠️ The removed signals are now owed to the bell — this is a debt, not a deletion

Part A took a real signal off the screen and part B has not landed, so **an organiser currently has
no ambient indication that anything is waiting on them** until they open the dashboard. That is an
accepted, deliberate gap (the pill was a bad way to close it), but it means part B **must** carry
these two, and they are the minimum bar for calling the bell done:

- **Refund requested** — an attendee is owed money and an organiser has to approve it (§21).
- **Awaiting payment** — a booking is holding a seat it has not paid for.

Both come from `organizerSource.attendees()` (`status !== "Confirmed"`), which is **dummy-mode only**
— the real backend serves no attendee list yet (§19). Do not ship the bell to real mode claiming to
watch these until it can.

### Part B `[BE]` — the bell becomes the one notification surface

**The bell is completely inert today.** `components/navbar/Navbar.tsx` → `BellButton()` is a button
with a `title="Notifications"` tooltip, no `onClick`, no badge and no data source. This is a build
from scratch, not a move.

**The decided shape (Gautham, 2026-09-02) — do not re-litigate these four:**

| Question | Decided |
|---|---|
| Audience | **Both.** Participant *and* organiser notifications in one bell. |
| Interaction | **A dropdown panel** listing individual items, each linking to the thing it is about — not a badge that merely navigates. |
| Chat button | **Untouched.** It keeps its own green-glow-plus-terracotta-dot for unread chat. Messages and notifications stay two visibly different concepts. |
| Participant sources | **Upcoming booked events** and **wishlist events starting soon.** |

**Match the existing dropdown, do not invent a second one.** `NavDropdown` and `AvatarMenu` in the
same file already establish the pattern: `activeMenu` state keyed by a `MenuKey`, `closeAll()` on
sibling hover, `LINEN` panel on a 1px `BORDER`, `rounded-xl shadow-xl`, and the **invisible bridge
div** (`absolute -top-1 inset-x-0 h-1`) that stops `onMouseLeave` firing while the pointer crosses
the `mt-1` gap. Add `"notifications"` to `MenuKey`. A panel of *rows that navigate* is not a
`DropdownItem` (emoji + label), so it needs its own row component — that is fine, but it should
still use `useHoverStyle` so it hovers green like everything else in the bar.

**Three traps, all previously paid for:**

- ⚠️ **The unread badge must be `absolute`-positioned over the glyph**, exactly like `ChatButton`'s
  dot. The navbar's search box is the row's only elastic element and the fit at **1024px** is
  arithmetic, not measured — anything that widens the button row means re-measuring at exactly
  1024px (see `CLAUDE.md` → Responsiveness, and the `w-[170px] xl:w-[410px]` comment in the file).
  An overlaid badge changes no width and avoids the whole problem.
- ⚠️ **Colour anything that hovers with CLASSES, not an inline `style`.** An inline colour beats a
  `hover:` rule; this has bitten the console table row, `FeatureBand`'s audience badge and
  `FilterSelect`'s menu items.
- ⚠️ **A notification is a promise to a user** — the `FeatureBand` rule applies here just as hard.
  Never render a row for something the app cannot actually do.

**What can be derived on the frontend today** (useful for judging how much of B is really backend):

| Row | Source | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| "X starts in N days" | `useTicketsStore` — `StoredTicket.start_date` / `event_title` | both |
| "X is this week, you haven't booked" | `useWishlistStore` — `WishlistItem.date` / `badgeType` | both |
| Refund requested · awaiting payment | `organizerSource.attendees()`, gated on the navbar's existing `isOrganizer` | dummy only |

The navbar **already knows who is an organiser** — `organizerApi.get(userId)` on a 5-minute
`staleTime` — so gating the organiser rows costs nothing new.

**Why this is still `[BE]` despite that table.** Everything above is *derived from local state the
user themself created*. A notification system is the opposite: things that happened **elsewhere**,
that persist, and that are individually **read or unread**. None of that exists. Missing:

1. **Somewhere to store them.** Per-user rows with `read_at`, survivable across devices and reloads.
2. **Producers.** Refund requested, payment failed, ticket issued, event cancelled or postponed
   (§20), organiser replies. Most already flow through Kafka — see `KAFKA_TOPIC_TICKET_ISSUED` and
   `KAFKA_TOPIC_PAYMENT_FAILED` in the notification service's config.
3. **Read endpoints.** `GET` a page of notifications, `POST` mark-read / mark-all-read, and an
   unread count cheap enough for the navbar to poll on every page.

⚠️ **The `notification` service is NOT a head start — it is a mailer.**
`backend/services/notification/` consumes Kafka and sends **email and SMS** (SendGrid + a Twilio
placeholder). It declares **no `DATABASE_URL`** — `CLAUDE.md` correctly lists it among the stateless
services — and `main.py` exposes **only a `/` health check**. It stores nothing and serves nothing a
UI can read. This feature needs a *notification feed*, which is either a new stateful service or a
new persistence layer plus routes inside this one. **Decide which before starting.**

⚠️ **Two live bugs in that service, found while scoping this.** Both are latent today because the
mailer is only ever exercised with no API key (it logs `SIMULATED EMAIL` and returns before
touching either):

- `notification_service.py:24` calls `self.jinja_env.get_project_template(template_name)`. Jinja2's
  `Environment` has **no such method** — it is `get_template()`. The first real send with
  `SENDGRID_API_KEY` set will `AttributeError`.
- `main.py:18` uses `@app.on_event("startup")`, deprecated in current FastAPI in favour of a
  `lifespan` handler.

**Open, not yet decided:** whether an organiser's notifications and a participant's are visually
separated inside the one panel (the navbar is split by audience everywhere else — see the
Participants / Organisers dropdowns — so mixing them in one flat list may read wrong), and what the
empty state says.
