// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  The organiser-authored extras: agenda, announcements, FAQ, offer name, cover
//  image — the fields the backend cannot store yet.
//
//  ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE ADDING AN AUTHORING CONTROL. There is no column for any
//  of them (`backend/services/event/app/models/event.py`), and neither
//  `EventCreate` nor `EventUpdate` accepts them, so a real-mode POST or PATCH
//  carrying one is dropped silently
//  by Pydantic — the organiser would type an agenda, press Save, watch the
//  server's reply overwrite the cache, and see their work disappear with no
//  error. That is the exact failure the console's `NotBuiltYet` exists to
//  prevent, so the rule here is the same one: **do not show a control that
//  cannot work.** Every editor disables itself off `EXTRAS_ARE_LOCAL` and
//  carries `EXTRAS_HINT` as its tooltip.
//
//  ⚠️ `EXTRAS_ARE_LOCAL` LIVES IN `data-source.ts`, not here, and that is
//  deliberate: this file is imported BY data-source (for `EXTRA_KEYS`), so
//  importing `isDummyMode` back out of it would close a module cycle and the
//  `const` would be read inside its own temporal dead zone — a hard crash at
//  import time, not a lint warning. Keep the arrow pointing one way.
//
//  ⚠️ `image_url` IS a real column — it is only in this set because it is
//  missing from `EventUpdate`, which is a one-line backend change rather than a
//  migration. When that line lands, take it out of `EXTRA_KEYS` first; it is the
//  cheapest of the five to make real. Spec for the rest: TODO.md §19.12.
//
//  The readers below exist because the backend returns Events WITHOUT these
//  keys, and a `.map()` over `undefined` throws. Every consumer goes through
//  them; never read `event.agenda` directly.
