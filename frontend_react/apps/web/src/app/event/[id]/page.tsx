              organiser wishlisting or sharing their own event is not what this
              view is for. Switch back to the participant view to get them —
              that is what the toggle at the head of this row is for.

              ⚠️ THREE IS THE CEILING here (Gautham, 2026-08-24). They sit in a
              48px gutter with their labels dropped below; a fourth starts
              crowding it at 375px. A further organiser action goes in the
              sidebar card, not in this row.

              ⚠️ DUPLICATE STAYS LIVE ON A CANCELLED EVENT, and the other two do
              not. Re-running an event that was called off is exactly when you
              want a copy of it; editing or re-cancelling one is not.

              ⚠️ THE ORGANISER'S HALF READS LEFT TO RIGHT AS state → lens →
              actions (Gautham, 2026-08-31): the lifecycle chip, then the view
              toggle, then the three round controls. Both labelled controls were
              full-width bands under the navbar until that date.

              ⚠️ The view TOGGLE shows in BOTH modes — it is how you get back, so
              hiding it in the participant preview would strand the organiser.
              The status chip shows in both too (Gautham, 2026-09-01), but as
              two different controls: a SELECT for the organiser, a FIXED chip
              for the participant. An organiser previewing gets the fixed one —
              the page a participant actually sees, which is the whole point.
              `EventStatus` owns that split; do not branch on it here.

              ⚠️ The cluster WRAPS rather than shrinking — three of its members
              are labelled controls, not 48px circles, and a draft at 375px has
              no honest single line. `shrink-0` on the cluster is what would
              break that. */}
