//  "Why NewFind" — the feature band between the Online Events row and
//  "Browse by category" on home.
//
//  BOTH AUDIENCES ARE ON SCREEN AT ONCE (Gautham, 2026-08-19). There is no
//  switch any more: the participant tiles sit left, the organiser tiles right,
//  and each tile names its own audience with a coloured dot. Do not put the
//  `RailToggle` back — hiding half the pitch behind a click was the thing that
//  was rejected.
//
//  ⚠️ THE CTA IS A TILE, not a button row under the grid. Each half ends with a
//  tile carrying the audience's one action (Explore events / Create an event),
//  so a half reads as one uninterrupted row. The old `BandCTA` outline-button
//  pair below the grid is gone — do not reinstate it.
//
//  ⚠️ EVERY CLAIM HERE IS A PROMISE TO A USER. Check STATUS.md before adding or
//  editing a card. Three things are deliberately absent and must not be added:
//    · "AI-powered personalised recommendations" — the engine is a keyword
//      match nothing on the frontend calls, and the `Recommended` badge can
//      never fire on a real event (TODO.md §2). It fails on the first click.
//    · "Sell tickets" as a working claim — checkout never confirms its Stripe
//      intent and tickets never reach the DB (TODO.md §11). The pricing card
//      states the FEE, not that selling works.
//    · "Verified organisers" — the trust line on /event/[id] is hardcoded
//      (TODO.md §1).
//  And the word "community" must not appear anywhere here — parked for Phase 2.
//
//  ⚠️ Three of the five live cards are forward-looking, by Gautham's call:
//    · CHAT    — rooms are live, but only after you book. The copy deliberately
//                never says WHEN you can chat, so it stays true either way. Do
//                not "clarify" it into "once you book". See TODO.md §7b.
//    · PRICING and STATS — not built. TODO.md §13 and §14.
//  Chat copy must also stay PRESENT-TENSE: message persistence is commented out
//  in the backend, so nothing survives a refresh. Never write "message your
//  attendees anytime" or "chat history".
//
//  ⚠️ The heading sets "NewFind" as the real `Wordmark`, not type. It inherits
//  `currentColor`, so the green comes from the span around it. The `1.1em`
//  height is a VISUAL match to the adjacent text, not a computed one — the
//  master viewBox includes the script's ascenders and descenders, so matching
//  the font-size numerically renders it too small. Re-eyeball it if the heading
//  size changes.
//
//  ⚠️ A FEATURE CARD IS NOT A LINK and must not become one — the hover fill is
//  feedback on a block of copy, not an affordance. **The two CTA tiles are the
//  exception and ARE links** (Gautham, 2026-08-20): a click anywhere in them
//  navigates. That is safe only because a CTA tile holds no inline link of its
//  own — see the note on `CTATile`. A card body MAY carry an inline
//  `BodyLink` (the stats card points at the organiser console), and that is only
//  safe BECAUSE the card is not a link: wrapping the card would make the inline
//  link a second tab stop competing with it, which is the same trap
//  `CategoryGrid`'s decorative arrow avoids. Hover uses the app-wide rule
//  (background → green, text → linen) via `group-hover:` classes rather than
//  inline styles, because an inline style cannot express a hover state.
//
//  ⚠️ THE BAND HAS NO WIDTH CAP — it runs gutter to gutter like every other
//  home section (Gautham, 2026-08-19). It was capped at 960 while it was three
//  cards behind a switch, and briefly at 1400 once both audiences shared a row;
//  seven tiles need the width, so the cap is gone. It still carries `GUTTERS`
//  and nothing is centred, so the heading keeps the left line it shares with
//  `EventsCarousel` above and `CategoryGrid` below. Do not add `margin: 0 auto`
//  and do not centre the text — a centred block was built and rejected, and
//  that answer still stands. See DESIGN_NOTES.md §1.

 *  identifies it — that shape and fill are the launcher's, from
 *  `EventChatWidget.tsx`.
 *
 *  The glyph is the app's own `SparkleIcon`, deliberately NOT a pixel copy of
 *  the launcher's two-star cluster: at this size the small second star is
 *  sub-pixel and just dirties the disc — the same reason `SparkleIcon` is one
 *  sparkle and not three (see its note in `EventIcons.tsx`).
 *
 *  ⚠️ Stays terracotta through the card's green hover fill, on purpose: it is a
 *  picture of a control that is always terracotta, not text that should invert.
 *
 *  ⚠️ `align-middle`, NOT a `vertical-align` offset in em. An inline-flex box
 *  takes its baseline from its first flex item, and an `<svg>` is a replaced
 *  element with no baseline of its own — so the browser synthesizes one from the
 *  glyph's BOTTOM edge, which hangs the whole disc below the line of text. Any
 *  em offset is then a guess layered on top of a synthesized number that shifts
 *  with the glyph's size. `middle` ignores the baseline entirely and centres the
 *  disc on the text's x-height, which is stable at any size. Do not "restore" a
 *  numeric drop here — that is what sat it low the first time.
 *
 *  The `-translate-y` on top of it is the nudge from the x-height centre up to
 *  the CAP-height centre — Roboto's x-height is ~0.53em and its cap height
 *  ~0.71em, so their midpoints differ by ~0.09em, and that is the whole constant.
 *  A disc this much taller than the text reads low when centred on lowercase.
 *  It is a transform, NOT a vertical-align offset, so it stays independent of
 *  the synthesized baseline above. Re-derive it from the two metrics if the font
 *  changes; don't re-guess it.
 *
 *  ⚠️ `rounded-full` is correct here and is not a breach of the shape rule —
 *  this depicts a round icon control, the one category the rule exempts. */

 *  call (2026-08-18): "the same colour, thickness, just like every other border
 *  in the website". A card is normally a non-control and would take 1px
 *  `--brand-border` — but at #E2DDD5 on #F2EFEA linen that is the
 *  invisible-border problem the 2px pass was introduced to fix, and /explore's
 *  filter sidebar is the same precedent (a panel, not a control, carrying 2px
 *  control-border). Keep 2px on BOTH states so the card cannot resize on hover.
 *
 *  `p-5`, not the old `p-6`: a tile is ~180px wide once seven of them share a
 *  row, and 24px of padding either side left the copy under 130px.
 *
 *  ⚠️ EVERY TILE CENTRES HORIZONTALLY (Gautham, 2026-08-19): `items-center` +

 *  without it the tile's `flex flex-col` stretches it into a colour bar.
 *
 *  ⚠️ VERTICAL alignment is NOT set here, on purpose. A feature tile is
 *  top-aligned (the flex default) so that every title in the row starts on the
 *  same line — centring them was built and rejected the same day, because the

 *  adds `justify-center`**, and it adds it rather than overriding a value from
 *  here: two conflicting utilities in one class string do not resolve by string
 *  order in Tailwind v4 (the generated stylesheet's order decides), which is the
 *  same trap `CategoryBadge` documents. Set it in one place, never both.
 *
 *  This is the TILE only — **the band's heading and subtitle stay left-aligned**,

 *  the badge's label once the tile is filled. So an organiser tile hovers
 *  terracotta, not green, which is the one place this band departs from the
 *  app-wide "hover → green" rule; it is deliberate, it is what separates the two
 *  halves at a glance, and it should not be swept back to green.
 *
 *  ⚠️ Derive, don't hand-pick. Each half is exactly one `--brand-<accent>` /
 *  `--brand-on-<accent>` pair, used five ways — the fifth being an inline
 *  `BodyLink` in the copy, which takes the accent at rest so a link matches the
 *  badge above it rather than importing the other half's colour. If you add a third audience or
 *  change an accent, change the pair here and nothing else — a colour written
 *  straight into a component is how the two halves drift apart.
 *
 *  ⚠️ `hover:` on the tile and `group-hover:` on its contents are CLASSES on
 *  purpose. An inline `style` cannot express a hover state at all, and an inline
 *  colour would beat the `group-hover:` rule on the children.
 *
 *  ⚠️ CONTRAST, stated so it is a known trade and not a surprise: linen on

 *
 *  ⚠️ IT IS STYLED AS A STATUS TAG (Gautham, 2026-08-19): "use the Selling Fast
 *  / This Week tags on the event card as the reference". Silhouette from
 *  `EventBadges`' exported `TAG_SHAPE`, then `gap-1.5 font-bold leading-5` +

 *  size changes, change these to match.** The one thing not copied is the glyph
 *  every status tag carries — say the word and it is `PeopleIcon` /
 *  `BriefcaseIcon` from `EventIcons`, the two this band used before the tiles
 *  lost their icon chips.
 *
 *  ⚠️ The badge must never be left to stretch. The tile is a `flex flex-col`,
 *  so under the default `align-items: stretch` it runs edge to edge as a colour
 *  bar; today `TILE`'s own `items-center` is what shrink-wraps it. If that
 *  centring is ever removed, put `self-start` back on this span.
 *
 *  ⚠️ EVERY badge INVERTS on hover, and it has to: the tile fills with that
 *  half's own accent, so the badge would otherwise be accent-on-accent and
 *  vanish. Inverted, it takes the `--brand-on-<accent>` fill and the accent as
 *  its label. All of it comes from `SKIN` — see the note there, and do not
 *  hand-write a colour here. (This is NOT the `AssistantLauncherGlyph` rule,

 *  with the feature tiles. It still takes the half's `SKIN`, so the organiser
 *  CTA hovers terracotta with the other three organiser tiles.
 *
 *  ⚠️ `justify-center` is THIS tile's alone (Gautham, 2026-08-19). Its two short
 *  lines sit centred against the taller feature tiles beside it, while those
 *  stay top-aligned so their titles all start on one line. `TILE` deliberately
 *  sets no vertical alignment — see the note there before moving this. */

          It is the one place in the app where a call to action is not green, and
          it is deliberate: this band is skinned by audience, not by control
          type. The hover foreground still follows the skin, because that accent

/** ⚠️ ONE FLAT GRID, not two nested half-grids (Gautham, 2026-08-19). The band
 *  used to render each audience as its own grid inside a 3/4 column split; that
 *  guaranteed the halves stayed grouped, but it also meant a half always started
 *  a NEW ROW — so at two-up the participants' CTA tile sat alone with a hole
 *  beside it instead of the first organiser tile. Flattening lets the tiles flow
 *  continuously at every width, and costs nothing at seven-up: document order is
 *  already 3 participants then 4 organisers, so `grid-cols-7` reproduces the
 *  split exactly, with equal widths for free.
 *
 *  ⚠️ These MUST stay direct children of the grid — no wrapper element per
 *  audience, which is why this is a `flatMap` and not a nested `map`. A wrapper
 *  is precisely the thing that reintroduced the row break.
 *
 *  Order is the message: participants first, and within each half the array
 *  order in `FEATURES` (see the note there). The CTA closes its own half. */

        {/* All seven tiles in one flow — see the note on `tiles()`.
            ⚠️ `band:grid-cols-7` is the whole design: 3 participants beside 4
            organisers, across the full page width. `band` is a REGISTERED 1400px
            breakpoint from globals.css.
            ⚠️ EVERY NARROWER STEP IS BOUND WITH `max-band:`, and that is not
            noise — it is the fix for a real bug. A wider breakpoint does not
            beat a narrower one by being wider: `band:` (like `min-[1400px]:`
            before it) is emitted BEFORE the built-in screens, so a plain
            `lg:grid-cols-4` sitting on this same element won at 1600px and the
            row rendered four-up. `max-band:` makes the ranges disjoint, so
            source order stops mattering. **Do not "simplify" these back to bare
            `sm:`/`md:`/`lg:`** — that is precisely the broken version. See the
            note beside `--breakpoint-band` in globals.css.
            The width itself is tied to the tile COUNT: neither
            `xl` (1280, where seven tiles are only ~150px each) nor `2xl` (1536,
            which would leave a 1440px laptop stacked); 1400 puts a tile near
            180px and 1440 near 190px. **Re-pick it if the count changes** — a
            briefly shipped five-tile version used `xl:grid-cols-5`.
            Below it the tiles wrap continuously rather than by half, so a row
            can hold the end of one audience and the start of the other. The
            counts step 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 to keep a tile from ~220px up; seven across
            a 1024px viewport would be ~115px, narrower than the words in them.
            Both audiences are always on the page at every width — this band is
            never behind a switch.
            ⚠️ `auto-rows-fr` + the tile's own `h-full` are what make EVERY tile
            the same height, and they are load-bearing once the tiles wrap: seven
            into three or four columns leaves the last row holding a lone CTA
            tile, which is the shortest content in the band, so without this it
            renders as a stub beside full-height cards. `minmax(0, 1fr)` rows in
            an auto-height grid all resolve to the tallest row's content, which
            is exactly what is wanted here. Do not drop it when changing the
            column counts. */}
