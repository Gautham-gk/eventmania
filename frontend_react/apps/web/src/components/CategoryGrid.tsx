//  "Browse by category" — the two-row rail that sits directly above the footer
//  on home.
//
//  A category tile borrows the EVENT CARD's chassis — same rounded-2xl, same
//  borderless-at-rest → 2px-border + 6px-lift hover, same aspect-video photo —
//  but it has NO BODY. The tile IS the photo, with the category's name riding on
//  a scrim at its bottom edge (Gautham's call: "no white space below the
//  photo"). The Explore button that used to sit in that body is GONE — the whole
//  tile was already a link to the same destination, so the button was a second
//  affordance for one action. Do not put a body or a CTA back.
//  Its columns are still sized to the home grid's cells, so a tile is exactly as
//  wide as an event card above it. If the event card's hover or radius changes,
//  change it here too.
//
//  The tile carries NO colour at rest — the photo is unwashed, exactly as on an
//  event card (Gautham's call; an earlier version washed the photo in the
//  category's accent at 62% and it read as a coloured block, not a photo).
//
//  The label is the SHARED `CategoryBadge` at `size="lg"` — the same linen chip
//  an event card overlays on its photo, scaled up. Because the chip brings its
//  own linen background there is no scrim: a version that put bare text on a
//  black gradient was built and replaced, and the photo is now wholly untouched.
//  Glyph and label take the RAW accent, which is correct on linen — that is the
//  surface those colours were contrast-checked against.
//
//  Opposite the chip sits a linen chip holding a green arrow, marking "explore
//  this category". ⚠️ It is DECORATION — `aria-hidden`, not focusable, no
//  handler — for the same reason the old Explore button was removed: the tile is
//  already a link to that destination, and a nested control would be a second
//  tab stop doing one job. Green-on-linen, never linen-on-green: a solid green
//  square read as a dark blob over most of the category photos.
//
//  ⚠️ The HOVER BORDER is the one place the raw accent will not do, because it
//  draws against the PAGE rather than against linen. It runs through
//  `liftAccent()` in dark mode; see the note on that function.

//
// The accents in `categoryStyle()` are tuned as text ON LINEN, so every one of
// them is DARK — Business is #334155, Networking #065F46. Inside the chip that
// is exactly right. The HOVER BORDER is the exception: it draws between the
// photo inside it and the PAGE outside it, and in dark mode that page is
// #0F1A18 — so a raw accent had dark on both sides and read as no border at all,
// which is precisely the bug that was reported.
//
// So for dark mode each accent is lifted to a fixed lightness + a saturation
// floor. **Only the L and S move — the HUE is untouched**, so this is still the
// category's own colour rather than a new one, and it is derived from
// `categoryStyle()` rather than hand-picked (never hardcode a category colour
// here). Measured against the dark page it runs 4.0–12.6:1.

          for something the tile already said: the whole tile is a link to that

          name. The chip is now name-only, and the tile's sole moving part on
          hover is the lift. (The `trailing` prop stays on the shared chip; it
          is generic, and nothing else in the file depended on the arrow.)

          Two earlier rounds died the same way and are also closed: an Explore
