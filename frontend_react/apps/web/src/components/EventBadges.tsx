//  Every event tag — ONE definition. Status tags (Free / Selling Fast / This
//  Week / …) at the top; the category tag (Music / Arts & Culture / …) below.
//
//  Rendered by the event cards (EventsCarousel) and the /event/[id] hero, so a
//  tag looks the same wherever it appears. Which tags an event gets is decided
//  in ONE place too: `toCarouselEvent()` in lib/card-adapters.ts.
//
//  Both families are soft-rectangular `rounded-lg` tags carrying a 14px glyph +
//  a label, and they differ ONLY in fill: a category chip is always linen with a
//  dark accent label, a status tag is a solid colour from Gautham's palette with
//  a linen label (a preview — see the CONTRAST note by BADGE_CONFIG). This
//  mirrors a reference design Gautham supplied; see HANDOVER.md inconsistency #6,
//  which records the shapes merging. Do not re-split them, do not round to pills.
//
//  Adding a tag? Add it to BADGE_CONFIG here AND emit it from toCarouselEvent —
//  a config entry with nothing emitting it is dead (see 'today'/'recommended').
//  Glyphs come from EventIcons.tsx; never draw one inline here.

// The palette is Gautham's: Mustard/Olive/Coral/Sky/Iris/Plum/Berry (Teal was
// in the original eight but Gautham dropped it). Each tag is a SOLID palette
// fill carrying a LINEN label + glyph (the site's own off-white,
// `--brand-surface` in light mode).
//
// ⚠️ CONTRAST: linen on these fills is effectively white-on-solid, and the
// palette is mid-tone (relative luminance 0.18–0.32, the worst zone for text),
// so EVERY assigned tag FAILS WCAG AA — measured linen-on-fill: Mustard 2.46,
// Sky 3.47, Iris 3.74, Plum 3.95, Coral 3.96 (reserves Olive 3.25, Berry 3.87);
// none reach 4.5. Gautham chose linen anyway to SEE the look; this
// is a preview, not an accessible final. The accessible version is a BLACK label
// (clears AA on all eight, 4.62–7.44) — see git history for the exact mapping.
// Only the label colour changed here; shape, glyphs and sizes are untouched.
//
// The fills being mid-tone holds shape on a dark event-card photo BETTER than
// the dark tints they replace (those measured ~1.2:1 at the near-black end and
// lost their outline against a dark photo).
//
// RESERVE — in the palette, not yet on a tag. Take from here before inventing a
// new colour, and record the assignment when you do:
//   Olive #7E8B3A, Berry #BC5675,
//   Rust #A8543A, Saffron #CFA02E, Lime #8FA83C, Aqua #2FA0A8, Denim #3E6FA0,
//   Grape #6A5AB8, Orchid #B85FB0, Rose #C85888, Slate #5F7080
//
// 'sold-out' deliberately keeps its neutral grey (Gautham's call): grey reads as
// unavailable, and a palette hue would make it compete with the live tags.
//
// 'today' and 'this-week' reuse the clock and calendar the cards already use
// rather than getting a second drawing of the same concept (HANDOVER.md: one icon
// per concept).

 *
 * THE RULE (Gautham's, and it counts STATUS tags only — the category chip is
 * never one of the three and is happy to share a row with two of them):
 *   • at most three status tags (`MAX_BADGES`)
 *   • with three, the third sits on the line ABOVE the other two
 *
 * So the bottom line is `[category] … [tag] [tag]` — three chips in a row is
 * exactly right when one of them is the category.
 *
 * WHY `flex-wrap-reverse` ON THE BOTTOM LINE. That line does not always fit a
 * 327px card (323px of row): measured, a category chip runs 91–175px ("Music" …
 * "Health & Wellness") and a status tag 72–124px ("Free" … "Selling Fast"), so
 * the combination ranges 175–414px. Rather than clip the right-hand tag (which
 * it did — on 12 of 23 fixture cards), the line wraps, and `-reverse` sends the
 * overflow UP. That is the same direction the third tag goes, so the block only
 * ever grows upward off the bottom edge and nothing is ever cut off. Give the
 * cards more width (a 3-across grid) and the wrapping stops on its own.
 *
 * The heroes have room for one line and use `CategoryBadge` + `EventBadges`
 * directly instead.
