//  The mode switch an organiser gets on their OWN event page.
//
//  ⚠️ IT LIVES IN THE HERO'S CONTROL ROW (Gautham, 2026-08-31), beside Edit /
//  Duplicate / Cancel — it replaced a full-width green band under the navbar
//  that carried the same two modes as a sentence plus a button. **Do not put the
//  band back.** The row is where the organiser's other controls already are, and
//  the page had two full-width bands stacked under the navbar before this.
//
//  ⚠️ **ORGANISER is the default mode** (Gautham, 2026-08-21) — an organiser
//  opening their own event arrives holding the controls, and previews the
//  participant's view deliberately. The reverse shipped first and was changed;
//  do not flip it back.
//
//  ⚠️ IT SHOWS IN BOTH MODES and is the only thing that NAMES the one you are
//  in: the two views otherwise differ by a few round controls in the hero, which
//  is easy to miss. The picked segment says it at rest, and the hover label
//  under the control says it in a sentence. **Keep both** — and if a third mode
//  is ever added, add it to `MODES` here rather than letting a page infer a mode
//  from something else.
//
//  ⚠️ EVERY SEGMENT ANSWERS THE POINTER, picked or not (Gautham, 2026-08-31) —
//  hovering the segment you are already in still shows its label. That is why
//  the copy comes in two forms: the picked one STATES the mode you are in, the
//  unpicked one OFFERS the switch. **Do not collapse them into one string** —
//  "You're viewing as the organiser" under a segment you are not in is a lie.
//
//  ⚠️ IT IS SKINNED AS ONE OF THE ROUND CONTROLS BESIDE IT (Gautham,
//  2026-08-31): a `--brand-surface` track — the same linen ground as an
//  `EventIconButton` — with `--brand-hint` labels, exactly the muted-glyph
//  colour those buttons wear at rest. **The picked segment is `--brand-green`**,
//  the app's own selected/CTA fill, with `--brand-on-green` on it.
//
//  ⚠️ It went through TWO earlier skins and neither is coming back: a
//  `--brand-green` track with a **terracotta** picked segment (carried over
//  from the band it replaced, changed because the control should read as part
//  of the hero's set rather than as a leftover band), and before that a linen
//  hover wash on the unpicked segment. **No gold either — there is no gold
//  token** (see `ConsoleUI`).
//
//  ⚠️ An unpicked segment takes NO hover FILL — only its label goes green,
//  which is precisely what the round buttons' glyphs do. Keep the two in step.
//
//  ⚠️ NO GLYPHS (Gautham, 2026-08-31). An eye rode on the preview segment and
//  was removed; two words say it without one. Do not re-add an icon here.
//
//  ⚠️ Rectangle with rounded edges, never a pill — the app's shape rule, and the
//  radius nests: `rounded-xl` track, `rounded-lg` segments.

          the header states for the label. Crossing the 4px gap between segments
          does not drop it: nothing clears `hovered` but the wrapper's
          `onMouseLeave`, so the ring cannot flicker mid-control. An inline
          style, so like the chip's it cannot be a `hover:` class. */}
