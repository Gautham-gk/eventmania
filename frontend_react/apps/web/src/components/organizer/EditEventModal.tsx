//  "Edit details" — the organiser's edit dialog on their own event page.
//
//  ⚠️ IT MIRRORS `/organizer/create` (Gautham, 2026-09-01). The rule is that
//  anything an organiser sets on the create form they can change here, and
//  anything `/event/[id]` renders they can set in both places. Three fields are
//  the deliberate exceptions, each read-only and each SAYING SO on the surface —
//  a field that is absent reads as a feature nobody built, one that is shown and
//  locked reads as a decision. **Do not make any of the three editable, and do
//  not delete them either.**
//
//  ⚠️ TITLE — SHOWN, NOT EDITABLE (Gautham, 2026-09-01). It is the one field a
//  ticket, a share image and a calendar entry all carry a copy of. It used to be
//  absent entirely; it is displayed now so an organiser can see the dialog is
//  about the right event.
//
//  ⚠️ PRICE AND CURRENCY — SHOWN, NOT EDITABLE (Gautham, 2026-09-01). This
//  REVERSES the 2026-08-24 decision that made the price editable with a warning:
//  a price is what a ticket, a receipt and every Earnings total were written in,
//  and the mixed-currency problem in TODO.md §19.10 is the same problem a moved
//  price has in miniature. Both are chosen once, on the create form. **Do not
//  re-add a price input without asking.**
//
//  ⚠️ CAPACITY IS STILL FREELY EDITABLE, including BELOW `tickets_sold`
//  (Gautham, 2026-08-24) — free edit, warning only. What the dialog owes the
//  organiser there is an honest sentence about who that affects, not a block.
//  **Do not add a floor**, and do not delete the warning either; it is the whole
//  of the guardrail.
//
//  ⚠️ THE SCHEDULE AND VENUE FIELDS ARE A POSTPONEMENT. Moving the date, the
//  time or the venue is not an edit to a listing, it is a change to an event
//  people have arranged their day around, and the backend does not treat it as
//  one yet: nothing notifies or emails the ticket holders. The dialog therefore
//  SAYS SO rather than implying someone else will handle it. **Do not soften
//  that line into "attendees will be notified" until TODO.md §20 is built** — it
//  would be a promise to an organiser that quietly costs their attendees the
//  event.
//
//  ⚠️ THE OFFER NAME AND THE COVER IMAGE HAVE NO BACKEND COLUMN. They are
//  disabled off `EXTRAS_ARE_LOCAL` and explain themselves with `EXTRAS_HINT` —
//  see `lib/event-extras.ts` and TODO.md §19.12. Everything else in this dialog
//  is real in both data modes.
