//  community cards (CommunityCarousel), the /event/[id] hero and the
//  /community/[slug] hero all render these, so no two surfaces can drift apart
//  again. If you need a share, favourite or back control anywhere new, import it
//  from here; do not hand-roll another one.
//
//  ⚠️ The `Event*` export prefix is historical — these are kind-agnostic now.
//  Pass `kind` to say which you are rendering; it drives the share URL, the
//  wishlist record and the aria-label.
//
//  All three share the same chrome: linen circle, muted icon that goes green on
//  hover — taking the button's ring with it, where it has one (`hoverEdge`) —
//  and a hover label that opens away from the edge it is anchored to.
